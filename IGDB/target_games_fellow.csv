After arriving at the station and eluding Combine forces, Gordon joins Lambda resistance members including Barney Calhoun, a former Black Mesa security guard now working undercover as a Combine CP officer, and Alyx Vance, the daughter of one of Gordon's former colleagues, Dr. Eli Vance. After a failed attempt to teleport Gordon to Black Mesa East from Dr. Kleiner's makeshift laboratory, Gordon, re-equipped with the HEV suit and a crowbar, is forced to embark on foot through the city's old canal system. After obtaining an airboat, he battles his way to Black Mesa East, several miles from the city. 
Gordon is reintroduced to Eli and meets Dr. Judith Mossman. Alyx introduces Gordon to her large pet robot D0g and gives him a ""Gravity Gun"", a weapon which allows Gordon to pick up and move any large object with ease. Black Mesa East soon comes under Combine attack and Eli and Mossman are captured to be taken to a Combine prison, Nova Prospekt. Gordon and Alyx are forced to take separate paths to Nova Prospekt; Gordon takes a detour through the town of Ravenholm, receiving help from its last survivor, Father Grigori. After making his way through the town and a mine, Gordon makes his way to a Resistance outpost. Gordon is provided with a Dune Buggy, which he uses to travel along a crumbling coastal road to Nova Prospekt. Along the way, Gordon encounters frequent Combine patrols, and helps one of the resistance leaders, Colonel Odessa Cubbage, to defend a Resistance base from a Combine gunship. 
After crossing an antlion-infested beach, Gordon enters Nova Prospekt, where he is reunited with Alyx. They manage to locate Eli, but also discover that Mossman is a Combine informant. Before they can stop her, she teleports herself and Eli back to City 17's Citadel. The Combine teleporter explodes as Gordon and Alyx use it to escape Nova Prospekt. 
Upon reaching Kleiner's lab, a shaken Dr. Kleiner reveals to Gordon and Alyx that they were caught in a ""slow teleport"", during which a week had passed. In their absence, the Resistance, who heard about what had happened at Nova Prospekt, has mobilized against the Combine, turning City 17 into a battleground. During the fighting, Alyx is captured by the Combine and taken to the Citadel, and Gordon fights through the city with the aid of D0g and Barney to reach it. Inside the Citadel, he is caught in a Combine confiscation chamber that destroys all of his weapons except for the Gravity Gun, the energy enhancing its capabilities and allowing Gordon to escape and dispatch platoons of Combine soldiers. 
Eventually, Gordon is captured riding in a Combine transport pod and is taken to Dr. Breen's office, where he and Dr. Mossman are waiting with Eli and Alyx in captivity. Dr. Breen begins to explain his plans for further conquest of the humans by the Combine, contrary to what he had told Dr. Mossman. Angered, Mossman frees Gordon, Alyx, and Eli before Breen teleports them off-world. Dr. Breen tries to escape through a portal, but Gordon pursues him and destroys the portal reactor with the super-charged Gravity Gun. Breen appears to be annihilated in the resulting explosion. Just before Gordon and Alyx are presumably met with a similar fate, time is frozen. The G-Man reappears, praising Gordon for his actions in City 17 and the Citadel. Making vague mention of ""offers for [Gordon's] services"", the G-Man places him back into stasis.","1998.

According to The Final Hours of Portal 2, the year is established to be ""somewhere in 2010""—twelve years after Aperture Science has been abandoned. 
 
The game begins with Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions and warnings from GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence, about upcoming tests. Chell enters into distinct chambers that introduce players to the game's mechanics, sequentially. GLaDOS's announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game, but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person.[4] Chell is promised cake as her reward if she completes all test chambers.[19] 
 
Chell proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center, with GLaDOS as her only interaction. As the player nears completion, GLaDOS's motives and behavior turn more sinister; although she is designed to appear encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, tests including a live-fire course designed for military androids, as well as some chambers flooded with a hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS notes the importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart on each face, for helping Chell to complete the test. However, GLaDOS declares it must be euthanized in an ""emergency intelligence incinerator"" before Chell can continue.[17] Some later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled.[20][21] 
 
After Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS maneuvers Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her. Chell escapes with the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center.[22] GLaDOS panics and insists that she was pretending to kill Chell as part of testing. GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the ""party escort submission position"", lying face-first on the ground, so that a ""party associate"" can take her to her reward, but Chell continues her escape. In this section, GLaDOS communes with Chell as it becomes clear the AI had killed everyone else in the center.[11][12] Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as ""the cake is a lie"", and pastiches of Emily Dickinson's poem ""The Chariot"", Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's ""The Reaper and the Flowers"", and Emily Brontë's ""No Coward Soul Is Mine"", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.[4] 
 
GLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to threaten Chell, but during the exchange, a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple ""personality cores"" that Aperture Science employees installed after the AI flooded the enrichment center with neurotoxin gas. With it removed, she can access its emitters again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS' personality cores, while GLaDOS discourages her both verbally, with taunts and juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After Chell destroys the last personality core, a malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. Following the announcement of Portal 2, the ending was expanded in a later update. In this retroactive continuity, Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice, thanking her for assuming the ""party escort submission position"".[15][23] 
 
The final scene, after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility, shows a Black Forest cake,[24] and the Weighted Companion Cube, surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores. The cores begin to light up, before a robotic arm descends and extinguishes the candle on the cake, causing the room to blackout.[25] As the credits roll, GLaDOS delivers a concluding report: the song ""Still Alive"", which declares the experiment to be a huge success, as well as serving to indicate to the player that GLaDOS is still alive,[26] that her ""happy"" core was not disabled.","Waking up in a seemingly empty laboratory, the player is made to complete various physics-based puzzle challenges through numerous test chambers in order to test out the new Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, without an explanation as to how, why or by whom.","Any[1, 18, 27, 268435461, 268435464, 268435465, 536871041, 536871049, 536871262, 536871470, 536871487, 536871515, 536871874, 536871878, 536871882, 536872064, 536872070, 536872205, 536872334, 536872352, 536872666, 536872810, 536872862, 536872885, 536872898, 536872961, 536872964, 536873111, 536873352, 536873787, 536874337, 536874398, 536874743, 536874916, 536875046, 536875047, 536875050, 536875057, 536875062, 536875069, 536875073, 536875117, 536875127, 536875158, 536875199, 536875216, 536875242, 536875244, 536875265, 536875271, 536875303, 536875326, 536875330, 536875358, 536875439, 536875440, 536875453, 536875490, 536875491, 536875492, 536875493, 536875497, 536875525, 536875529, 536875538, 536875542, 536875545, 536875593, 536875701, 536875800, 536875804, 536875808, 536875830, 536875837, 536875840, 536875856, 536875923, 536876008, 536876087, 536876097, 536876167, 536876170, 536876174, 536876191, 536876214, 536876274, 536876294, 536876353, 536876356, 536876362, 536876391, 536876466, 536876478, 536876520, 536876552, 536876555, 536876563, 536876645, 536876649, 536876690, 536876724, 536876763, 536876854, 536876869, 536876910, 536876913, 536876922, 536876946, 536877049, 536877077, 536877101, 536877207, 536877275, 536877289, 536877305, 536877380, 536877533, 536877540, 536877567, 536877583, 536877620, 536877646, 536877647, 536877672, 536877762, 536877780, 536877858, 536877960, 536877961, 536878228, 536878256, 536878333, 536878388, 536878482, 536878515, 536878520, 536878565, 536879053, 536879174, 536879223, 536879742, 536879894, 536879913, 536880065, 536880253, 536880343, 536880743, 536880765, 536880901, 536880902, 536881248, 536881249, 536881266, 536881935, 536881937, 536882362, 536882386, 536882666, 536882967, 536883035, 536883039, 536883354, 536883643, 536883945, 536883995, 536884125, 536885136, 536885292, 536885424, 536885425]",Any[3],Any[1],Null,"Any[99702, 99703]","Any[3, 6, 9, 12, 14, 34]","Any[72, 231, 247, 338, 571, 1006, 7386, 9727, 21798]",Portal

To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy's most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.","Are you prepared to lose everything to save the galaxy? You'll need to be, Commander Shephard. It's time to bring together your greatest allies and recruit the galaxy's fighting elite to continue the resistance against the invading Reapers. So steel yourself, because this is an astronomical mission where sacrifices must be made. You'll face tougher choices and new, deadlier enemies.

Game Features: 
 
Shift the fight in your favour. Equip yourself with powerful new weapons almost instantly thanks to a new inventory system. Plus, an improved health regeneration system means you'll spend less time hunting for restorative items. 
 
Make every decision matter. Divisive crew members are just the tip of the iceberg, Commander, because you'll also be tasked with issues of intergalactic diplomacy. And time's a wastin' so don't be afraid to use new prompt-based actions that let you interrupt conversations, even if they could alter the fate of your crew...and the galaxy. 
 
Forge new alliances, carefully. You'll fight alongside some of your most trustworthy crew members, but you'll also get the opportunity to recruit new talent. Just choose your new partners with care because the fate of the galaxy rests on your shoulders, Commander.","Any[1, 18, 268435461, 268435468, 268435469, 536870915, 536870934, 536870984, 536871041,

He arrives at the Anomalous Materials Lab, his work place, and he is informed by the security officer that the scientists have a special experiment today, so he goes to the locker room and puts on the hazard suit. He goes to the lab's lower levels, and arrives at the Anti-Mass Chamber, where he is instructed that the specimen to be used that day is the rarest and also the most unstable specimen. He is tasked with pushing the specimen into the scanning beam of the Anti-Mass Spectrometer for analysis. However as soon as he pushes it, it explodes, and creates a sudden catastrophe called a ""resonance cascade"", opening a portal between Earth and a dimension called Xen. Freeman is apparently teleported to an alien planet and catches glimpses of various alien lifeforms, including a circle of Vortigaunts, shortly before blacking out.","Dr. Gordon Freeman doesn't speak, but he's got a helluva story to tell. This first-person roller-coaster initiated a new era in the history of action games by combining engrossing gameplay, upgraded graphics, ingenious level design and a revolutionary story that may not be all that it seems, told not through cutscenes, but through the visual environment.","Any[1, 18, 19, 20, 39, 268435461, 268435465, 268435487, 536870915, 536870934, 536871041, 536871049, 536871213, 536871365, 536871378, 536871470, 536871475, 536871506, 536871882, 536871937, 536871939, 536872032, 536872070, 536872225, 536872550, 536872733, 536872798, 536872898, 536873111, 536873362, 536873874, 536873999, 536874115, 536874398, 536874552, 536874743, 536874843, 536874900, 536875046, 536875058, 536875073, 536875081, 536875083, 536875095, 536875199, 536875242, 536875265, 536875271, 536875488, 536875491, 536875492, 536875525, 536875532, 536875537, 536875538, 536875545, 536875574, 536875593, 536875689, 536875691, 536875693, 536875803, 536875804, 536875808, 536875810, 536875814, 536875819, 536875822, 536875830, 536875868, 536875874, 536875902, 536875907, 536875908, 536875934, 536875941, 536876011, 536876068, 536876093, 536876094, 536876176, 536876221, 536876235, 536876261, 536876325, 536876331, 536876348, 536876362, 536876365, 536876406, 536876423, 536876454, 536876469, 536876551, 536876587, 536876645, 536876648, 536876649, 536876660, 536876685, 536876686, 536876748, 536876854, 536876871, 536876874, 536876877, 536876899, 536876922, 536877049, 536877101, 536877108, 536877128, 536877193, 536877221, 536877227, 536877229, 536877230, 536877239, 536877251, 536877341, 536877407, 536877443, 536877532, 536877533, 536877567, 536877647, 536877648, 536877666, 536877724, 536877950, 536877952, 536877955, 536877961, 536877976, 536878002, 536878004, 536878009, 536878070, 536878074, 536878132, 536878228, 536878322, 536878346, 536878381, 536878387, 536878388, 536878419, 536878483, 536878515, 536878597, 536879050, 536879704, 536879705, 536879706, 536879707, 536879757, 536879808, 536879869, 536879870, 536879871, 536879914, 536880090, 536880137, 536880341, 536880490, 536880655, 536880659, 536880687, 536880732, 536880765, 536880786, 536880892, 536880893, 536880894, 536880895, 536880896, 536880897, 536880899, 536880900, 536880901, 536880903, 536880960, 536881668, 536882725, 536883219, 536883884, 536883944, 536884032, 536884033, 536884125, 536885281, 536885424, 536886212, 536886392]","Any[3, 4]","Any[1, 2]",Null,"Any[18908, 42057, 96883]","Any[6, 8, 14]","Any[233, 241, 247, 356, 571, 1006, 2031, 6739, 7351]",Half-Life

Welcome to the 1980s.  
  
Having just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take over the city himself.","In the year 1986, Tommy Vercetti is heavily indebted to his mafia superiors after a drug deal gone awry, but his dreams of taking over Vice City (based on Miami) push him down a different path.

Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets. 
 
There, Batman learns that the Joker returned to the asylum to gain access to Young, who has been developing Titan—a more powerful version of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength—intending to use it to help patients survive more strenuous therapies. Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker's return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and the fear toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents' deaths. After he recovers, Batman destroys Young's Titan formula and rescues Young from Victor Zsasz. An explosion kills Young and the Joker obtains the completed batches of Titan. 
 
At the Penitentiary, Quinn releases Poison Ivy from her cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production facility in the Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create an antidote and learns that it can only be made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment. 
 
Batman returns to the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants. The Joker announces that the preparations for his party are finally complete and Batman travels to the asylum's visitor center where the Joker's applauding henchmen welcome him. The Joker reveals he has recaptured Gordon and tries to shoot him with a Titan-filled dart; Batman leaps to Gordon's defense and is shot instead. Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Joker—who is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum. Batman overhears a call about a crime led by Two-Face in progress and flies back to Gotham City in the Batwing. In a post-credits scene, a crate of Titan formula is shown floating in the ocean near the asylum when a hand surfaces and grabs it.","Using a great variety of gadgets you must make your way around the island, and the asylums halls to find and stop the joker. The game uses a 3-button combat system, but with a great number of gadget abilites which Batman can unlock. This makes for a very cinematic combat experience when fighting the Joker's goons.","Any[1, 23, 268435481, 268435487, 536870926, 536870934, 536871019, 536871127, 536871382, 536871877, 536871939, 536871944, 536871945, 536872371, 536872393, 536872406, 536872883, 536873810, 536874452, 536874552, 536875011, 536875047, 536875157, 536875222, 536875257, 536875418, 536875432, 536875453, 536875492, 536875537, 536875638, 536875764, 536875809, 536875819, 536875889, 536875934, 536876007, 536876171, 536876235, 536876487, 536876570, 536876757, 536876763, 536876826, 536876929, 536876978, 536877032, 536877075, 536877239, 536877495, 536877533, 536878246, 536878247, 536878249, 536878250, 536878263, 536878264, 536878586, 536879992, 536879993, 536879994, 536880353, 536884867, 536888127, 536893368, 536893369]",Any[6],Any[1],Null,"Any[5653, 42241, 106795, 106796]","Any[6, 9, 12, 72]","Any[471, 501, 1266, 2003, 3025, 4755, 5503, 7689, 19565]",Batman: Arkham Asylum

He must rescue Elizabeth, a mysterious girl imprisoned since childhood and locked up in the flying city of Columbia. Forced to trust one another, Booker and Elizabeth form a powerful bond during their daring escape. Together, they learn to harness an expanding arsenal of weapons and abilities, as they fight on zeppelins in the clouds, along high-speed Sky-Lines, and down in the streets of Columbia, all while surviving the threats of the air-city and uncovering its dark secret.","This first-person story-driven shooter and entry in the Bioshock franchise follows Booker DeWitt as he enters the floating independent (formerly US) city of Columbia in 1912 and attempts to retrieve a girl trapped in a tower by the city's self-proclaimed despot/prophet in order to erase his financial debt. Throughout the story, themes of violence, racism and fatalism are brought up.","Any[1, 17, 18, 19, 22, 31, 268435461, 268435487, 536870934, 536871041, 536871082, 536871195, 536871226, 536871341,

By her suggestion and against Whitman's advice, the expedition ventures into the Dragon's Triangle, east of Japan. The ship is struck by a violent storm and shipwrecked, leaving the survivors stranded on an isolated island. Lara is separated from the others and captured by a strange, savage man. She manages to escape while her captor is killed as the cave collapses due to her actions. As Lara tries to locate the other survivors, she finds more evidence that the island is inhabited, such as strange carvings, dead bodies, and animal sacrifices. She eventually finds her friend Sam and a man called Mathias, who claims to be a teacher who was shipwrecked on the island. As Sam tells Mathias the legends of Himiko, Lara passes out; when she wakes, Mathias and Sam are nowhere in sight. When Lara regroups with the other survivors, Whitman decides to go with Lara and search for the still-missing Roth, while the rest of the group (Reyes, Jonah, Alex and Grim) set out to find Sam and Mathias. As Lara and Whitman explore, they discover that the island's inhabitants are worshipping Himiko, confirming that the island is Yamatai. Upon discovering a shrine erected in Himiko's name, they are captured by the islanders and taken to a settlement along with several other survivors from the Endurance. When the survivors attempt an escape, the captors turn on them. Lara is separated from Whitman and tries to hide, but is found by one of the islanders and forced to kill him. She fights off the remainder of the attackers and reunites with Roth, saving him from a wolf attack. 
 
Lara manages to activate a radio tower and call for help, but the plane that answers the call is struck by a freak storm, and Lara hears a mysterious voice saying ""No one leaves"" in Japanese. Unable to save the surviving pilots, Lara is contacted by Alex and Reyes, who reveal that Sam has been kidnapped by the islanders, a violent cult known as the Solarii Brotherhood. Lara tries to rescue her, but is stopped by Mathias, leader of the Solarii, and ordered killed: she is saved by an attack from samurai-like Oni. Escaping the ancient monastery where she is taken by the Oni, she hears from Sam that Mathias is going to put her through the ""Ascension"", a ""fire ritual"" to find the next Sun Queen that will burn her to death if it is unsuccessful. Lara follows them to the Solarii fortress and is aided by Grim. The Solarii take Grim hostage, but he sacrifices himself so Lara can escape. With Roth's aid, Lara infiltrates the fortress and sees the ritual begin. When the fires are lit, a great wind blows them out, showing Sam to be the next Sun Queen. Lara escapes again and reunites with her friends, forming a plan to rescue Sam and escape. Aided by Whitman—who has managed to negotiate some degree of freedom with the Solarii—Lara returns to the palace to rescue Sam as Roth commandeers a helicopter to get them out. Lara succeeds, but persuades Sam to escape by land when she sees another storm gathering as the helicopter approaches. As Lara tries to force the helicopter pilot to land, they are brought down, with Lara nearly dying. Roth revives Lara, then takes a fatal blow from Mathias meant for Lara. While mourning Roth, Lara accepts that the storms are not natural, but are somehow connected to the Sun Queen and designed to prevent anyone from leaving the island. She meets up with the other survivors, who have evaded the Solarii long enough to secure a boat for escaping the island, provided that it can be repaired. They are joined by Whitman, who claims to have escaped, though Lara begins to suspect him of working with the cultists. Lara and Alex find parts for the boat in the wreck of the Endurance. They come under attack by the Solarii and Alex triggers an explosion, sacrificing himself so that Lara can escape with the tools. 
 
Finding an account of a World War II-era Japanese military and Nazi scientific expedition to the island that sought a way to harness the storms as a weapon, Lara decides to explore a coastal tomb, where she finds the remains of a samurai general who committed seppuku. It is revealed in a message he left that he led the Queen's Stormguard, the Oni that defend the monastery, and that the Queen's successor took her own life rather than receive the Sun Queen's power. Lara realizes that the Ascension is not a ceremony to crown a new queen, but rather a ritual that transfers the original Sun Queen's soul into a new body; the Sun Queen had learned to become effectively immortal by transferring her soul into a young girl's body each time she grew old. The last priestess' suicide had interrupted the ritual, and left the Queen's soul trapped in her old decaying body, and Himiko's spirit has wanted to escape that corpse ever since. As a descendant of Yamatai, Sam is a viable candidate, and Mathias plans to offer Sam as a new host in exchange for his freedom. Lara returns to the survivors on the beach to find that Whitman has betrayed them, abducting Sam and handing her over to Mathias. Lara, Jonah and Reyes give chase, heading up a river to the monastery, with Lara arriving just in time to see Mathias trick Whitman into approaching and speaking to the Oni: the Oni kill Whitman. After fighting her way through both the Solarii and the Stormguard, Lara arrives at the top of the monastery where Mathias is performing the Ascension ritual. Lara fights her way to the central platform, and after a struggle, knocks Mathias off the platform to his death. Symbolically, she does so using both her pistol and his in a dual-wield style that will later become one of her signatures. Despite Mathias' death, the ritual is already underway, with Himiko's soul starting to pour into Sam, but Lara then destroys Himiko's ancient remains, saving Sam and dispersing the storms. Lara, Sam, Reyes and Jonah then leave the island and are picked up by a cargo ship: as they sail home, Lara realizes that the mythical stories her father told her were more than stories, deciding not to return home just yet, and the screen fades to white with a proclamation of ""A Survivor is Born.""","Tomb Raider explores the intense and gritty origin story of Lara Croft and her ascent from a young woman to a hardened survivor. Armed only with raw instincts and the ability to push beyond the limits of human endurance, Lara must fight to unravel the dark history of a forgotten island to escape its relentless hold.","Any[1,

Hugo Strange discloses his knowledge of Wayne's dual identity as Batman before releasing him into the prison's criminal populace. While Strange prepares to commence ""Protocol 10"", Wayne obtains his equipment via airdrop from Alfred Pennyworth, allowing him to become Batman. He first saves Catwoman from being executed by Two-Face, who hopes to gain respect by murdering her. After Joker attempts to assassinate Catwoman, Batman tracks him to his hideout in the Sionis Steelmill, believing Joker may know the truth behind Protocol 10. 
 
There, Batman learns that the unstable properties of the Titan formula are mutating in Joker's blood, gradually killing him. Joker captures Batman and performs a blood transfusion on him, infecting him with the same fatal disease. Joker also reveals that Gotham hospitals have been poisoned with his infected blood. Desperate to save himself and innocent citizens, Batman seeks out Mr. Freeze, who had been developing a cure but has since been kidnapped by the Penguin. 
 
Tracking Penguin to the Cyrus Pinkney National History Institute, Batman defeats his forces, his imprisoned monster Solomon Grundy, and ultimately the Penguin himself, before liberating Mr. Freeze. Freeze tells Batman that he has already developed the cure, but its instability renders it useless. Batman deduces that the restorative properties of Ra's al Ghul's blood can complete the cure. Batman tracks one of Ra's al Ghul's assassins to his underground lair, leading Batman into a confrontation with Ra's and his daughter Talia, Batman's former lover. With Ra's al Ghul's blood, Freeze is able to develop an antidote, but it is stolen by Harley Quinn before Batman can use it. 
 
When he returns to the Joker, Batman finds him restored to health. While the two fight, Strange activates Protocol 10, which is revealed to be a scheme to wipe out the entire population of Arkham City and destroy the criminal element of Gotham. The TYGER troops begin executing inmates as Strange launches missile strikes on Arkham's denizens from his base in Wonder Tower. A missile hits the steelmill, burying Batman under rubble. Before Joker can take advantage of the situation, Talia arrives and offers him immortality in exchange for sparing Batman's life. After escaping with the help of Catwoman, Batman is convinced by Alfred to end Protocol 10 before pursuing Talia and Joker. 
 
Batman infiltrates Wonder Tower and disables Protocol 10. Ra's al Ghul is revealed to be the true mastermind behind Arkham City and mortally wounds Strange for failing to defeat Batman. With his dying breath, Strange activates ""Protocol 11"", the self-destruction of Wonder Tower. Batman and Ra's escape, but Ra's commits suicide rather than risk capture. Joker contacts Batman, threatening to kill Talia unless Batman meets him at the Monarch Theater. Once Batman arrives, Joker demands the cure but is stabbed and apparently killed by Talia while distracted. Talia admits to stealing the cure from Quinn, when she is killed by a second Joker, still stricken with the disease. The healthy Joker that Talia stabbed then reanimates into the shapeshifting Clayface, who is revealed to have been masquerading as a healthy Joker all along at the ailing villain's request. 
 
Batman incapacitates Clayface, but Joker blows up the theater floor, sending Batman plummeting into Ra's' lair below. Batman destroys Ra's' rejuvenating Lazarus Pit before the Joker can use it, and drinks a portion of the antidote. Batman debates curing his foe but is attacked by Joker before he can act, causing the antidote vial to inadvertently smash. Batman admits that in spite of everything Joker had done, he would have saved him. After Joker finally succumbs to his illness and dies, Batman carries his body out of Arkham City. As Commissioner Gordon asks what happened, Batman places Joker's body on the hood of a police car and leaves in silence.","After the events of Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009), a section of the city of Gotham has been turned into a prison, designed to keep the scum of the city away from the people.

Build the final force. Build a team from a variety of races and classes and combine their skills to overcome impossible odds. You'll be joined by newcomers like James Vega, a tough-as-nails soldier, as well as EDI, a trusted AI in a newly acquired physical form. Keep an eye out for beloved characters from your past, but beware. Some may not survive the final battle...

In addition to blocks, the environment features plants, mobs, and items. Some activities in the game include mining for ore, fighting hostile mobs, and crafting new blocks and tools by gathering various resources found in the game. The game's open-ended model allows players to create structures, creations, and artwork on various multiplayer servers or their single-player maps. Other features include redstone circuits for logic computations and remote actions, minecarts and tracks, and a mysterious underworld called the Nether. A designated but completely optional goal of the game is to travel to a dimension called the End, and defeat the ender dragon.","Any[17, 21, 33, 38, 41, 268435460, 268435469, 268435487, 268435489, 536870983, 536871010, 536871029, 536871033, 536871065, 536871139, 536871208, 536871213, 536871244, 536871251, 536871289, 536871304, 536871421, 536871422, 536871443, 536871458, 536871470, 536871489, 536871506, 536871507, 536871529, 536871535, 536871570, 536871682, 536871889, 536871942, 536871945, 536872010, 536872015, 536872073, 536872205, 536872245, 536872257, 536872307, 536872371, 536872504, 536872557, 536872558, 536872622, 536872628, 536872647, 536872862, 536872928, 536873024, 536873030, 536873089, 536873092, 536873236, 536873249, 536873326, 536873364, 536873440, 536873454, 536873833, 536874022, 536874115, 536874373, 536874542, 536874706, 536874743, 536874834, 536875042, 536875046, 536875052, 536875066, 536875073, 536875090, 536875096, 536875106, 536875109, 536875122, 536875134, 536875147, 536875159, 536875173, 536875185, 536875214, 536875229, 536875232, 536875233, 536875241, 536875242, 536875244, 536875253, 536875259, 536875267, 536875271, 536875275, 536875276, 536875304, 536875305, 536875313, 536875320, 536875330, 536875331, 536875340, 536875343, 536875344, 536875372, 536875377, 536875388, 536875427, 536875453, 536875461, 536875464, 536875488, 536875491, 536875492, 536875494, 536875502, 536875503, 536875517, 536875521, 536875541, 536875606, 536875607, 536875629, 536875640, 536875650, 536875665, 536875668, 536875675, 536875693, 536875699, 536875712, 536875735, 536875737, 536875741, 536875753, 536875758, 536875760, 536875778, 536875781, 536875791, 536875795, 536875802, 536875804, 536875809, 536875830, 536875832, 536875837, 536875872, 536875939, 536875941, 536876010, 536876033, 536876063, 536876068, 536876121, 536876126, 536876128, 536876171, 536876220, 536876228, 536876229, 536876240, 536876260, 536876263, 536876264, 536876274, 536876282, 536876287, 536876299, 536876304, 536876318, 536876334, 536876339, 536876374, 536876416, 536876417, 536876424, 536876435, 536876444, 536876466, 536876473, 536876497, 536876525, 536876528, 536876571, 536876572, 536876580, 536876587, 536876621, 536876632, 536876678, 536876718, 536876762, 536876769, 536876877, 536876880, 536876884, 536876948, 536877040, 536877101, 536877124, 536877211, 536877305, 536877352, 536877368, 536877387, 536877407, 536877423, 536877565, 536877570, 536877583, 536877716, 536877738, 536877749, 536877761, 536877816, 536877864, 536877882, 536877910, 536877915, 536877955, 536878232, 536878239, 536878294, 536878314, 536878315, 536878322, 536878388, 536878511, 536878512, 536878523, 536878574, 536879112, 536879113, 536879781, 536879842, 536879950, 536879957, 536879999, 536880292, 536880444, 536880459, 536880461, 536880471, 536880524, 536880592, 536880863, 536880905, 536880960, 536882054, 536882392, 536882427, 536882694, 536882817, 536882890, 536882973, 536883166, 536883234, 536883271, 536883300, 536883371, 536883675, 536883709, 536883710, 536883712, 536883713, 536883714, 536883715, 536883716, 536883717, 536883718, 536887739, 536887745, 536887747, 536887749, 536887750, 536888127, 536889519, 536890607, 536890703]",Any[217],"Any[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]","Any[11137, 11138, 11139]",Any[102771],"Any[3, 6, 14]","Any[472, 533, 1164, 1334, 1879, 1942, 1991, 3025, 3042]",Minecraft

doctor and scientist in Vault 101. James frequently makes comments about the player character's deceased mother Catherine, and her favorite Bible passage, Revelation 21:6, which speaks of ""the waters of life"". 
 
The main quest begins after the player is forced to flee Vault 101 when James leaves the vault, throwing it into anarchy and causing the paranoid Overseer to send his security force after the player. The search for James takes the character on a journey through the Wasteland, first to the nearby town of Megaton, named for the undetonated atomic bomb at the center of town, then the Galaxy News Radio station, whose enthusiastic DJ Three Dog gives the player the moniker of ""The Lone Wanderer"". The player travels to Rivet City, a derelict aircraft carrier now serving as a fortified human settlement. Here the player meets Doctor Li, a scientist who worked alongside the player's father. Doctor Li informs the player of Project Purity, a plan conceived by Catherine and James to purify all the water in the Tidal Basin and eventually the entire Potomac River with a giant water purifier built in the Jefferson Memorial. However, continued delays and Catherine's death during childbirth put an end to the project, and James took the player's character as a newborn to raise them in the safety of Vault 101. 
 
After investigating the Jefferson Memorial, the Lone Wanderer tracks James to Vault 112, and frees him from a virtual reality program being run by the Vault's sadistic Overseer, Dr. Braun. James and the player return to Rivet City, and James reveals he sought out Braun for information on the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.), a device that contains the components needed to finally activate Project Purity. James and Doctor Li lead a team of Rivet City scientists to the memorial with intent to restart the project, but the memorial is invaded by the Enclave, a powerful military organization formed from the remnants of the pre-War United States government. James floods the project's control room with radiation to stop the Enclave military leader, Colonel Augustus Autumn, from taking control of it, killing himself (but Autumn survives), his last words urging his child to run. The Lone Wanderer and Dr. Li flee to the ruins of the Pentagon, now a base for the Brotherhood of Steel and now known as the Citadel. 
 
With Project Purity still inoperable even with the Enclave occupying the site, the player travels to Vault 87 to find a G.E.C.K. and finish James's work. The player finds the Vault to be a testing site for the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus), and the source of the Super Mutants in the Capital Wasteland. After the player acquires the G.E.C.K., the Wanderer is ambushed by the Enclave and captured. 
 
At the Enclave base at Raven Rock, the player is freed from their cell by the Enclave leader, President John Henry Eden, who requests a private audience with them. En route to his office however, Colonel Autumn defies Eden's orders and takes command of the Enclave military, ordering them to kill the player. Fighting their way to Eden's office, the player discovers Eden is actually a sentient ZAX series supercomputer who took control of the Enclave after their defeat in Fallout 2 on the West Coast thirty years ago. Eden wishes to repeat the plan of then-President Dick Richardson using Project Purity, infecting the water with a modified strain of FEV that will make it toxic to any mutated life. This plan will kill most life in the wasteland including humans, but the Enclave, due to their genetic ""purity"" as a result of their isolation, will be immune and free to take control of the area. The Wanderer, provided with a sample of the new F.E.V., is given a choice to either leave peacefully or convince Eden to self-destruct the entire base. The Lone Wanderer escapes Raven Rock and returns to the Citadel. 
 
With the knowledge they possess, the G.E.C.K. and the means to activate Project Purity, the Brotherhood assault the Jefferson Memorial, spearheaded by a giant robot named Liberty Prime. In the control room of Project Purity the player confronts Colonel Autumn, and has the choice to persuade him to give up or kill him. Dr. Li informs the player that the purifier is ready to be activated, but the activation code must be input manually, and also that the control room is flooded with lethal amounts of radiation. The Lone Wanderer is forced to choose between sending Sarah Lyons of the Brotherhood inside the extremely irradiated purifier or entering themselves. Whoever enters into the chamber inputs the code hinted at through the game, that being 21:6, and dies from a radiation spike.","Fallout 3 from the creators of the award-winning Oblivion, featuring one of the most realized game worlds ever created. Create any kind of character you want and explore the open wastes of post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. Every minute is a fight for survival as you encounter Super Mutants, Ghouls, Raiders and other dangers of the Wasteland. Prepare for the future. 
 
The third game in the Fallout series, Fallout 3 is a singleplayer action role-playing game (RPG) set in a post-apocalyptic Washington DC. Combining the horrific insanity of the Cold War era theory of mutually assured destruction gone terribly wrong, with the kitschy naivety of American 1950s nuclear propaganda, Fallout 3 will satisfy both players familiar with the popular first two games in its series as well as those coming to the franchise for the first time.","Any[1, 18, 21, 33, 38, 268435461, 268435468, 536870915, 536870920,

After being found by a friendly local robot, Victor, and healed by a man named Doc Mitchell, the Courier is thrust back into the desert to seek revenge and recover the stolen package. Through doing this, the player becomes caught up between various factions competing for control over the desert and it's most valuable asset, the Hoover Dam; ultimately coming to shape the future of its inhabitants.","In this first-person Western RPG, the player takes on the role of Courier 6, barely surviving after being robbed of their cargo, shot and put into a shallow grave by a New Vegas mob boss. The Courier sets out to track down their robbers and retrieve their cargo, and winds up getting tangled in the complex ideological and socioeconomic web of the many factions and settlements of post-nuclear Nevada.","Any[1, 18, 21, 33, 38, 268435461, 268435468, 536870915, 536870932, 536870969, 536870979, 536870981, 536870991, 536871041, 536871044, 536871134, 536871213, 536871240, 536871251,

In LIFE IS STRANGE the player has the power to affect the game’s narrative and also change the course of history itself.","Any[1, 17, 18, 31, 268435468, 268435487, 536870938, 536870939, 536870984, 536871082, 536871183, 536871470, 536871738, 536871813, 536871874, 536871878, 536871882, 536871939, 536871945, 536871991, 536872140, 536872184, 536872205, 536872638, 536872695, 536872746, 536873318, 536873486, 536873658, 536873907, 536874706, 536875006, 536875046, 536875057, 536875092, 536875098, 536875110, 536875114, 536875132, 536875153, 536875157, 536875199, 536875216, 536875229, 536875256, 536875257, 536875265, 536875271, 536875326, 536875330, 536875344, 536875358, 536875420, 536875437, 536875494, 536875498, 536875504, 536875506, 536875511, 536875513, 536875515, 536875523, 536875537, 536875545, 536875552, 536875572, 536875637, 536875645, 536875649, 536875650, 536875678, 536875695, 536875700, 536875708, 536875741, 536875742, 536875743, 536875745, 536875747, 536875749, 536875767, 536875781, 536875782, 536875831, 536875880, 536875885, 536875887, 536875889, 536875923, 536876072, 536876073, 536876098, 536876108, 536876109, 536876128, 536876129, 536876134, 536876178, 536876180, 536876188, 536876229, 536876241, 536876274, 536876291, 536876292, 536876317, 536876322, 536876332, 536876333, 536876335, 536876336, 536876338, 536876344, 536876372, 536876456, 536876459, 536876461, 536876473, 536876616, 536876617, 536876625, 536876711, 536876767, 536876821, 536876867, 536876901, 536876922, 536876923, 536876924, 536876932, 536876968, 536877029, 536877173, 536877183, 536877268, 536877337, 536877340, 536877341, 536877345, 536877361, 536877624, 536878100, 536878426, 536878584, 536879192, 536879824, 536879879, 536880062, 536880164, 536880884, 536881450, 536881451, 536881452, 536881453, 536881454, 536881455, 536890500]",Any[6],Any[1],Any[7492],"Any[58954, 58955, 58956]","Any[3, 6, 9, 12, 14, 34, 39, 48, 49]","Any[1342, 1906, 2993, 3042, 3188, 9727, 11233, 11270, 19441]",Life is Strange

He then experiences flashbacks from three years ago and the last two days he experienced. Three years earlier, on August 22nd 1998, Max was working as a regular NYPD detective, having just finished his day's work. His longtime friend and DEA agent, Alex Balder, invites him to transfer into the DEA, but Max declines the offer, wanting to focus on his full-time life with his wife, Michelle, and their newborn daughter, Rose. As he returns to his house in New Jersey, he finds that a trio of junkies had broken into his house, all addicted on a brand new designer drug, Valkyr. Max receives a call from a mysterious woman who seems pleased at the trouble in the house and refuses to call for help. Max rushes to aid his family and kill the junkies, but is too late as he finds his wife shot dead, and his daughter slaughtered. After his family's funeral, Payne accepts Alex's offer, and transfers to the DEA at his own request to stop the spreading of the drugs.","Max Payne, gritty ex-cop and titular hero of this third-person shooter, sets out on his own to take revenge on those who murdered his wife and child, only for the plot he's involved in to get deeper and deeper. As his guilt and trauma build, Payne finds himself in more and more impossibly unfavourable and astounding situations, which challenge his methods, his worldview, and even his existence.","Any[1, 20, 268435461, 536870997, 536871133, 536871134, 536871213, 536871420, 536871470, 536871506, 536871577, 536871937, 536871944, 536871945, 536872048, 536872070, 536872221, 536872315, 536872581, 536872587, 536872622, 536872691, 536872715, 536872810, 536873053, 536873082, 536873973, 536873999, 536874452, 536874947, 536875046, 536875058, 536875073, 536875081, 536875097, 536875098, 536875199, 536875209, 536875216, 536875271, 536875310, 536875322, 536875328, 536875358, 536875400, 536875403, 536875435, 536875436, 536875437, 536875453, 536875483, 536875495, 536875504, 536875506, 536875523, 536875525, 536875527, 536875538, 536875570, 536875572, 536875609, 536875638, 536875639, 536875642, 536875728, 536875731, 536875761, 536875787, 536875803, 536875804, 536875822, 536875830, 536875870, 536875880, 536875907, 536876062, 536876068, 536876087, 536876093, 536876094, 536876103, 536876167, 536876175, 536876176, 536876178, 536876258, 536876261, 536876262, 536876294, 536876322, 536876327, 536876332, 536876348, 536876384, 536876426, 536876453, 536876454, 536876466, 536876482, 536876505, 536876606, 536876644, 536876645, 536876685, 536876687, 536876695, 536876725, 536876812, 536876877, 536876973, 536876987, 536877015, 536877101, 536877163, 536877169, 536877239, 536877278, 536877286, 536877302, 536877309, 536877329, 536877383, 536877386, 536877452, 536877623, 536877625, 536877628, 536877664, 536877665, 536877782, 536877950, 536877963, 536878008, 536878024, 536878083, 536878209, 536878265, 536878266, 536878317, 536878505, 536879020, 536879025, 536879095, 536879678, 536879707, 536879731, 536879870, 536879895, 536879958, 536880274, 536880294, 536880311, 536880441, 536880565, 536880610, 536880639, 536880640, 536880769, 536880805, 536880845, 536880901, 536880960, 536881079, 536881123, 536881277, 536881320, 536881414, 536881456, 536882132, 536882158, 536882445, 536882470, 536882494, 536882730, 536882765, 536882878, 536883035, 536883130, 536883144, 536883261, 536883318, 536884005, 536884030, 536884031, 536884033, 536884207, 536884390, 536884417, 536884840, 536884857, 536884862, 536885031, 536885061, 536885591, 536887429, 536889479, 536893599, 536893600, 536893601]",Any[67],Any[1],Null,"Any[801, 17915, 42242, 42245, 42247, 42248, 42250, 42251, 58168, 99757, 99758, 99759]","Any[6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 34, 39, 48]","Any[41, 43, 241, 564, 571, 960, 1009, 1020, 19441]",Max Payne

It’s time to join the Brotherhood.","Any[1, 17, 18, 22, 23, 33, 38, 268435487, 536870934, 536870984, 536871033, 536871041, 536871044, 536871063, 536871127, 536871133, 536871139, 536871169, 536871213, 536871291, 536871302, 536871304, 536871470, 536871506, 536871535, 536871758, 536871878, 536871882, 536871904, 536871945, 536872014, 536872205, 536872229, 536872245, 536872352, 536872371, 536872550, 536872587, 536872626, 536872798, 536872957, 536872983, 536873154, 536873192, 536873456, 536873457, 536873473, 536873999, 536874345, 536874398, 536874743, 536874745, 536875067, 536875073, 536875081, 536875091, 536875157, 536875178, 536875185, 536875196, 536875197, 536875199, 536875306, 536875311, 536875356, 536875358, 536875396, 536875432, 536875437, 536875456, 536875494, 536875523, 536875525, 536875534, 536875623, 536875689, 536875693, 536875699, 536875764, 536875778, 536875802, 536875803, 536875808, 536875819, 536875822, 536875830, 536875837, 536875886, 536875896, 536875902, 536875910, 536875934, 536875951, 536876007, 536876031, 536876054, 536876087, 536876184, 536876220, 536876221, 536876232, 536876235, 536876241, 536876261, 536876266, 536876273, 536876281, 536876429, 536876471, 536876477, 536876487, 536876499, 536876511, 536876545, 536876587, 536876706, 536876730, 536876875, 536876911, 536877124, 536877125, 536877150, 536877216, 536877230, 536877383, 536877451, 536877453, 536877623, 536877985, 536878007, 536878367, 536878562, 536879062, 536879063, 536879064, 536879069, 536879077, 536879078, 536879080, 536879082, 536879084, 536879085, 536879087, 536879212, 536879744, 536879745, 536879751, 536879763, 536879769, 536879781, 536879782, 536879783, 536880068, 536880548, 536881831, 536891152, 536892870, 536892871]","Any[8, 9]","Any[1, 2]",Null,"Any[3668, 3670, 63944, 63945, 63946, 63947]","Any[6, 9, 12, 48]","Any[127, 128, 529, 537, 1006, 1266, 1970, 3025, 5606]",Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood

However, the train is a trap set by Handsome Jack, and it explodes. The Vault Hunters regain consciousness in a frozen wasteland and are found by the last remaining Hyperion CL4P-TP (""Claptrap"") unit. The Guardian Angel contacts the Vault Hunters and instructs them to accompany Claptrap to the city of Sanctuary, and to join the Crimson Raiders, an anti-Hyperion resistance movement, in order to defeat Handsome Jack. Claptrap and the Vault Hunters are able to escape the frozen wastes after defeating Captain Flynt, the local bandit leader, and retaking Claptrap's boat. Along the way, Handsome Jack taunts the Vault Hunters, while the Guardian Angel offers advice and comfort. 
Upon arriving at the gates of Sanctuary, the Vault Hunters are asked to rescue Roland, now leader of the Crimson Raiders, who has been captured by a bounty hunter called the Firehawk. The Vault Hunters meet the Firehawk, who turns out to be Lilith(an existing and playable character in Borderlands), whose powers as a siren have been significantly enhanced by the new supply of eridium. Lilith informs the Vault Hunters that Roland was actually captured by a group of bandits. After fighting through the bandits' territory, the Vault Hunters rescue Roland and return to Sanctuary. 
Roland and Lilith learn that the Vault Key is being transported aboard a Hyperion train, and task the Vault Hunters to retrieve it. To accomplish the mission, the Vault Hunters enlist the aid of former Vault Hunter Mordecai, and of Tiny Tina, a psychotic explosives-obsessed thirteen-year-old. The Vault Hunters derail the train, but instead of finding the Vault Key, they encounter Wilhelm, a powerful Hyperion cyborg. After Wilhelm's defeat, the Vault Hunters recover his power core, which Roland recommends be used as the power source for Sanctuary's shields. The power core turns out to be a trap; it allows the Guardian Angel, who is actually working for Jack, to lower the city's shields and render it vulnerable to a bombardment from the Hyperion moon satellite. Lilith saves Sanctuary, which was originally a large spacecraft, by activating its engines and teleporting it away; for the rest of the game, Sanctuary exists as a flying city in the sky. 
Jack's true plan is revealed: to open Pandora's second Vault and unleash The Warrior, a powerful lava, eridium, and rock creature controlled by whomever releases it. Additionally, he is forcing Angel to help him charge the Vault Key more quickly than usual. Angel communicates with the group in Sanctuary, and despite hostile treatment from Roland, divulges that the Vault Key is kept with her in a Hyperion facility. She also shares information about the formidable defenses of the facility. The Vault Hunters embark upon a series of missions in order to assemble what is needed to overcome these defenses, including obtaining an upgrade for Claptrap, visiting the Hyperion city of Opportunity, and enlisting the aid of Brick, now leader of the Slab clan of bandits. During the process, Mordecai's pet bird Bloodwing is captured and killed by Handsome Jack; a grief-stricken Mordecai vows revenge and joins the other three former Vault Hunters at Sanctuary. Roland and the Vault Hunters assault the Hyperion compound and meet Angel, who is not only a real person, but a siren, and Handsome Jack's daughter. She requests to be killed in order to stop her father from charging the Vault Key and gaining control of The Warrior. Handsome Jack sends in waves of security forces in order to protect his daughter, but ultimately, Roland and the Vault Hunters, with the help of late arrival Lilith, successfully kill Angel. An enraged Handsome Jack teleports in, kills Roland, and captures Lilith, whom he forces to resume charging the Vault Key in Angel's stead. Lilith manages to teleport the Vault Hunter out of the facility and back to Sanctuary. 
Mordecai and Brick decide to learn the location of the second Vault and confront Handsome Jack and The Warrior. While the Vault Hunters travel to the Hyperion Information Annex and obtains the Vault's location, the two steal a Hyperion ship. The Vault Hunters approach on foot, battling elite Hyperion security forces, while Brick and Mordecai are shot down but left alive. Ultimately, the Vault Hunters confront, battle, and defeat Handsome Jack himself, but arrive too late to prevent him from opening the Vault. Handsome Jack summons The Warrior, a gargantuan dragon-like lava creature, and orders it to kill the Vault Hunters. After a long battle, the Vault Hunters defeat the Warrior, and executes Handsome Jack in the aftermath. 
Brick and Mordecai arrive just as Lilith attempts to destroy the Vault Key. However, she accidentally activates a secret information bank containing a huge map of the galaxy with several Vaults marked on it. Lilith remarks that ""there ain't no rest for the wicked"" before the screen fades to black.","Five years after the events of Borderlands, a valuable mineral called ""Eridium"" starts flourishing through Pandora's crust. Handsome Jack, the leader of the Hyperion Corporation, secures this new resource and uses it to rule over Pandora with an iron fist. Meanwhile, rumors of an even larger Vault hidden on Pandora spread across the galaxy, drawing a new group of Vault Hunters to the planet in search of it.","Any[1, 18, 27, 33, 268435461, 268435468, 536871262, 536871365, 536871417, 536871452, 536871835, 536871882, 536871938, 536872371, 536872622, 536872942, 536875157, 536875169, 536875358, 536875483, 536875484, 536875521, 536875572, 536875610, 536875624, 536875638, 536875699, 536875781, 536875782, 536875796, 536875800, 536875809, 536875819, 536875937, 536876125, 536876262, 536876265, 536876359, 536876487, 536876527, 536876545, 536876871, 536877043, 536877109, 536877162, 536877165, 536877217, 536877264, 536877375, 536878317, 536878332, 536880409, 536882054, 536882715, 536887633, 536888363, 536889479, 536891456, 536891882, 536891883]",Any[6],"Any[1, 2, 3, 4]","Any[730, 10051, 10064]","Any[3861, 18953, 42019, 42020, 95841]","Any[3, 6, 9, 12, 14, 34, 46, 48]","Any[73, 498, 1877, 1939, 5574, 6032, 15536, 18290, 55038]",Borderlands 2

The player, as Mario or Luigi, is able to defeat enemies by stomping them or using items that bestow magical powers. Mario and Luigi are given a wider range of abilities than in previous Super Mario games, including flying or sliding down slopes. In addition, Super Mario Bros. 3 introduces numerous elements, such as new enemy characters and the use of a world map to transition between levels, that have reappeared in or have influenced subsequent Mario games.","Any[1, 268435464, 268435487, 536870928, 536871186, 536871193, 536871208, 536871470, 536871851, 536871872, 536871904, 536871939, 536872010, 536872098, 536872120, 536872232, 536872622, 536872961, 536873024, 536873064, 536873077, 536873111, 536873186, 536873236, 536873671, 536873973, 536874209, 536874398, 536874745, 536874813, 536874834, 536875056, 536875072, 536875073, 536875075, 536875081, 536875091, 536875101, 536875130, 536875131, 536875175, 536875199, 536875213, 536875214, 536875262, 536875286, 536875308, 536875391, 536875392, 536875396, 536875433, 536875434, 536875437, 536875491, 536875606, 536875623, 536875700, 536875830, 536875852, 536875921, 536875934, 536875944, 536876083, 536876120, 536876259, 536876353, 536876499, 536876510, 536876540, 536876543, 536876558, 536876611, 536876615, 536876618, 536876634, 536876713, 536876751, 536876952, 536876953, 536877049, 536877050, 536877051, 536877052, 536877055, 536877062, 536877063, 536877065, 536877066, 536877067, 536877068, 536877069, 536877071, 536877075, 536877084, 536877085, 536877086, 536877087, 536877088, 536877089, 536877090, 536877091, 536877093, 536877096, 536877104, 536877115, 536877116, 536877277, 536877434, 536877575, 536877655, 536877710, 536877711, 536877712, 536877716, 536877717, 536877718, 536877720, 536877783, 536877940, 536878148, 536878154, 536878157, 536878217, 536878505, 536879791, 536879801, 536879802, 536879803, 536879805, 536880106, 536880107, 536880158, 536880227, 536880283, 536880360, 536880766, 536880992, 536880993, 536881003, 536881356, 536881490, 536881665, 536881843, 536881947, 536882290, 536882310, 536882311, 536882312, 536882760, 536883574, 536883715, 536883785, 536883787, 536883790, 536883793, 536884027, 536885567, 536885568, 536885569, 536885570, 536885571, 536886003, 536886319]",Null,"Any[1, 2]",Null,"Any[97440, 97441]","Any[5, 18, 37, 41]","Any[358, 1067, 1074, 1078, 1079, 2180, 3340, 3349, 22301]",Super Mario Bros. 3

Barret, the group's leader, believes the Mako energy the reactors consume to be the planet's lifeblood, and Shinra's reactors are killing the planet. Cloud's childhood friend, Tifa, is also in the group. Although the first mission is successful, AVALANCHE is ambushed at the next reactor during a subsequent raid. When the reactor explodes, Cloud drops down into Midgar's slums. He is found by Aerith (aka Aeris), a girl he briefly met selling flowers after his first mission with AVALANCHE. Prompted by the arrival of the Turks, who have been sent to capture Aerith, Cloud agrees to act as her bodyguard and defends her from their assault. Meanwhile, Shinra learns the location of AVALANCHE's hideout in Sector 7, and subsequently destroys it by dropping the upper plate of Sector 7 onto the slums, killing its population. The Turks also capture Aerith, who is revealed to be the last surviving ""Cetra"", an ancient near-dead tribe closely attuned with the planet. President Shinra and Professor Hojo believe Aerith is the key to finding the ""Promised Land"", a mythical land of fertility they see as an abundant source of Mako. The remaining AVALANCHE members - Cloud, Barret and Tifa - infiltrate Shinra to rescue Aerith, in the process encountering a specimen simply labeled ""Jenova"". Joined by Red XIII, a sentient tiger-like creature on whom Hojo had been conducting experiments, the party rescues Aerith, but is captured by the Turks while trying to escape and detained within the building. In the morning, they find their cells open and most of the personnel, including President Shinra, killed: the perpetrator appears to be Sephiroth, a legendary SOLDIER leader who was presumed dead several years ago.The group discovers that the Jenova specimen is also missing, presumed stolen by Sephiroth. 
 
While the president's son, Rufus Shinra, assumes control of the company, the party leaves Midgar and pursues Sephiroth across the planet. They are joined by Cait Sith, a cat-robot secretly controlled by repentant Turk Reeve Tuesti; Yuffie Kisaragi, a teenage ninja from Wutai; Vincent Valentine, a former Turk; and Cid Highwind, a chain-smoking pilot. At a Cetra temple, the party encounters Sephiroth, who reveals his plan: if the world is significantly damaged, the Lifestream, made of pure Mako energy, will gather in an attempt to heal the wound. Sephiroth intends to use the legendary Black Materia to cast a spell called ""Meteor"" to cause a massive injury, enabling him to merge with the planet's Mako energy and be reborn as a god. The party drives off Sephiroth, acquiring the Black Materia, but Sephiroth manipulates Cloud into giving him the Materia. While the party recovers from the encounter, Aerith sets off to stop Sephiroth on her own, following him to an ancient Cetra city. The party follows, and finds Aerith praying to the planet for aid. Just as they reach her, Sephiroth kills her. Cloud and his allies track Sephiroth to the North Crater. During their journey, they find out that Jenova is an interstellar creature who crashed on the planet roughly two thousand years ago, intent on taking over completely. Attempting to defend itself, the planet created giant monsters called Weapons. While most humans fled, the Cetra managed to defeat Jenova and entomb its remains. A few decades before the present, the remains of Jenova were unearthed by Professor Gast, a researcher for Shinra. Mistaking Jenova for a Cetra, Gast attempted to clone Jenova, assisted by Hojo. Even though Gast abandoned the project, Hojo successfully managed to use his assistant's unborn child for the experiment: the baby was Sephiroth. Approximately five years before the present day, while on a Shinra mission with Cloud to Cloud's and Tifa's hometown of Nibelheim, Sephiroth encountered Hojo's failed test subjects and learned of his origins. Mistakenly believing that Jenova and he were Cetra, he was driven insane and destroyed Nibelheim as an act of vengeance on the normal human population. Cloud and Tifa confronted Sephiroth during the massacre, after which Sephiroth vanished, presumed dead until his reappearance in the present day. 
 
When the party reaches the Northern Crater to confront Sephiroth for killing Aerith, they learn that Sephiroth was one of multiple Jenova clones that Hojo had created from both animals and humans. Upon reaching Sephiroth, who has been killing and absorbing the Jenova clones to instigate a ""Reunion"" of Jenova's cells, he manipulates Cloud into helping him cast Meteor, then states that Cloud is one of Sephiroth's clones, showing him memories of the Nibelheim incident with a black-haired SOLDIER in Cloud's place. The summoning of Meteor activates the planet's Weapons, and during the subsequent earthquake, Cloud is separated from his companions and falls into the Lifestream. The rest of the party and the Turks that had followed them to the Crater escape on the airship, the Highwind, where the party members are placed under arrest. As Meteor approaches the planet, the Weapons turn on humanity in an attempt to return as much Mako energy to the Lifestream as possible to aid the planet. Shinra focuses its efforts on protecting humanity from the Weapons and attempting to destroy Meteor directly, which eventually costs the lives of the majority of Shinra's personnel.[31] Tifa, Barret and the others are sentenced to be executed, but escape. They find a catatonic Cloud at a hospital in a tropical resort, where he washed up following the events at the North Crater. Tifa stays behind to help Cloud recover, while the rest of the party continue their fight against Shinra. An attack by the Weapons destroys the island, and Cloud and Tifa both fall into the Lifestream. There, Tifa helps Cloud reconstruct his memories and learns the truth about his past. 
 
It is revealed that Cloud was not accepted into SOLDIER, and that the SOLDIER in Sephiroth's visions was Aerith's first love and Cloud's friend, Zack Fair. The two were present during the Nibelheim incident, with Cloud managing to fatally wound Sephiroth, who only survived through Jenova's cells: Zack and Cloud were severely wounded and later taken and used by Hojo to perfect his SOLDIER and Jenova experiments. Zack tried escaping with Cloud but was killed by Shinra soldiers. Cloud recovered, took Zack's sword and made his way to Midgar: Cloud's own aspirations to SOLDIER and Zack's memories and stories combined, with the help of the Jenova treatment, to create a false personality. Realizing and accepting his past, Cloud is able to recover. After Cloud and Tifa emerge from the Lifestream, the party regroup and learn that Aerith, in her final moments, was attempting to use the White Materia to cast the spell ""Holy"", the only means of opposing Meteor. It turns out she was successful in casting the spell, but Sephiroth has been preventing its release. The group decide to first stop the rampage of the Weapons. Alongside this, the party confront Hojo, revealed to be Sephiroth's father, as the scientist attempts to aid his son by feeding Mako energy to him. After mutating himself with Jenova cells, he is killed in combat. After this, they launch their final assault on Sephiroth, who is defeated by Cloud after a series of battles. The party escapes from the crater as Holy is released. Holy attempts to block Meteor under Midgar, but Meteor has drawn too close for Holy to combat it alone. Just before Meteor's impact, the Lifestream rises from the planet to aid Holy in destroying Meteor. Five hundred years later, Red XIII is seen with two cubs looking out over the ruins of Midgar, which are now covered in greenery, showing the planet has healed.","Set in a dystopian world, Final Fantasy VII's story centers on mercenary Cloud Strife who joins with several others to stop the megacorporation Shinra, which is draining the life of the planet to use as an energy source. As the story progresses, the situation escalates and Cloud and his allies face Sephiroth, the game's main antagonist.","Any[17, 18, 268435468, 268435487, 536870969, 536870988, 536870990, 536871015, 536871139, 536871208, 536871327, 536871390, 536871423, 536871433, 536871470, 536871473, 536871529, 536871791, 536871835, 536871882, 536871938, 536872098, 536872100, 536872120, 536872121, 536872201, 536872211, 536872352, 536872419, 536872793, 536873327, 536873591, 536873780, 536873914, 536874094, 536874190, 536874727, 536874822, 536875057, 536875059, 536875081, 536875125, 536875158, 536875161, 536875225, 536875241, 536875262, 536875271, 536875275, 536875281, 536875284, 536875337, 536875340, 536875343, 536875358, 536875372, 536875390, 536875420, 536875436, 536875457, 536875464, 536875472, 536875527, 536875534, 536875537, 536875573, 536875608, 536875639, 536875658, 536875752, 536875767, 536875791, 536875792, 536875819, 536875832, 536875833, 536875855, 536875874, 536875910, 536875953, 536876007, 536876029, 536876084, 536876114, 536876167, 536876189, 536876211, 536876219, 536876231, 536876235, 536876240, 536876263, 536876287, 536876378, 536876387, 536876454, 536876455, 536876482, 536876499, 536876505, 536876528, 536876546, 536876606, 536876797, 536876818, 536876828, 536876875, 536876901, 536876910, 536876978, 536876982, 536877006, 536877133, 536877169, 536877172, 536877210, 536877216, 536877238, 536877297, 536877383, 536877386, 536877390, 536877394, 536877422, 536877424, 536877440, 536877454, 536877543, 536877594, 536877767, 536877769, 536877839, 536877984, 536878017, 536878067, 536878078, 536878097, 536878107, 536878117, 536878216, 536878267, 536878299, 536878384, 536878405, 536878441, 536878488, 536878502, 536878588, 536878589, 536879206, 536879212, 536879793, 536879895, 536879898, 536879940, 536880171, 536880197, 536880238, 536880239, 536880241, 536880242, 536880256, 536880261, 536880268, 536880286, 536880386, 536880443, 536880471, 536880472, 536880473, 536880607, 536880706, 536880747, 536880748, 536880803, 536881123, 536881125, 536881163, 536881260, 536881267, 536881470, 536881601, 536881990, 536882365, 536882689, 536882799, 536882819, 536882973, 536882988, 536883632, 536883667, 536885058, 536885278, 536885317, 536887229, 536887230, 536887231, 536893915, 536893916, 536893917, 536893918, 536893919, 536893920, 536893921, 536893922]",Null,Any[1],Null,"Any[5824, 19567, 19568, 95831, 95833]","Any[6, 7, 39, 45, 48, 49, 130]","Any[384, 393, 398, 421, 425, 426, 428, 1342, 7194]",Final Fantasy VII

You are the last hope of the Jedi Order. Can you master the awesome power of the Force on your quest to save the Republic? Or will you fall to the lure of the dark side? Hero or villain, savior or conqueror... you alone will determine the destiny of the entire galaxy! 
 
Former Jedi Darth Malak, a Dark Lord of the Sith and Darth Revan's former apprentice, has unleashed a Sith armada against the Republic. Malak's aggression has left the Jedi scattered and vulnerable; many Jedi Knights have fallen in battle and others have sworn allegiance to Malak. 
 
The game opens with the player's character—the player can choose a face and be male or female (canonically a male)—awakening aboard the Republic ship, Endar Spire, which is under attack by Malak's forces. The player's character gradually gathers companions and pieces together their past while attempting to stop Malak. 
 
The game is a part of the Star Wars Legends Universe.","Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is a role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by LucasArts. The game's system is based on Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Roleplaying Game, which is based on the d20 role-playing game system derived from the Third Edition Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) rules. 
 
Players choose from three basic character classes at the beginning of the game, and later choose from three Jedi sub-classes. Beyond class, a character has ""skills"" stats, tiered ""feats"", and later on, tiered Force powers, similar to magic spells in fantasy games.

You are the once-trusted bodyguard of the beloved Empress. Framed for her murder, you become an infamous assassin, known only by the disturbing mask that has become your calling card. In a time of uncertainty, when the city is besieged by plague and ruled by a corrupt government armed with industrial technologies, dark forces conspire to bestow upon you abilities beyond those of any common man – but at what cost? The truth behind your betrayal is as murky as the waters surrounding the city, and the life you once had is gone forever","Dishonored is an immersive first-person action game that casts you as a supernatural assassin driven by revenge. With Dishonored’s flexible combat system, creatively eliminate your targets as you combine the supernatural abilities, weapons and unusual gadgets at your disposal. Pursue your enemies under the cover of darkness or ruthlessly attack them head on with weapons drawn. The outcome of each mission plays out based on the choices you make.","Any[1, 23, 268435487, 536870934, 536870984, 536871041, 536871044, 536871071, 536871133, 536871138, 536871139, 536871213,

In the blink of an eye, everything is taken from you – your friends, your family, and even your own life. Resurrected by a mysterious vengeful spirit, you must now embark on a relentless vendetta against those who have wronged you.","Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is a open world third-person action role-playing video game developed by Monolith Productions and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, which takes place in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Legendarium. 
 
The game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life. 
 
The game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor. 
 
The melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm, using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player's combo multiplier. 
 
A unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory.

The disease, known as ""Green Poison"" or ""The Dollar Flu"", causes widespread chaos, and Manhattan is placed under quarantine. The U.S. Government activates sleeper agents in the population who operate for the Strategic Homeland Defense Agency , or simply ""The Division"", to assist emergency responders, now called the Joint Task Force (JTF), in restoring order. In Brooklyn, the protagonist, a Division agent, assists the JTF before planning to depart for the Quarantine zone with fellow agent Faye Lau. However, the VTOL meant to take them there is destroyed in an explosion, killing the Division Commander and wounding Faye Lau. Arriving in a JTF helicopter instead, the Division agents reclaim the James A. Farley Post Office Building as their base of operations. From there, the agents undertake assignments to rescue important personnel, help in restoring the base of operations to full working capacity and combat criminal groups, such as the Rioters, common street thugs in New York who generally want to take advantage of the quarantine, the Rikers, escapees from Rikers Island, and the Cleaners, insane New York Sanitation workers who wield flamethrowers and believe everyone is infected. In the course of the game, the agent helps rescue important personnel like Dr. Jessica Kandel, Captain Roy Benitez and Paul Rhodes. These personnel head the Medical, Security and Tech wings of the base of operations respectively. Agents also recover a sample of Green Poison. Studying the sample reveals the virus was manufactured and then modified heavily by a controversial biologist named Gordon Amherst. 
 
Eventually, the agents find footage of Division agent Aaron Keener going rogue and killing other agents. It is also discovered Keener and other agents who went rogue along with him are assisting the ""Last Man Battalion"" (LMB), a traitorous private military company that was abandoned by the government during the evacuation, now hostile to it. Working together, these two groups destroyed the VTOL and killed the Commander to weaken Division operations in New York. Intercepting a signal from the Russian consulate, the agents attempt to rescue Vitaly Tchernenko, a Russian virologist who claims to have information on the Green Poison. However, he is kidnapped by Keener and the LMB before the Division can reach him. After helping the JTF secure supplies and weapons, the JTF and Division agents launch an attack on the LMB's base, the evacuated United Nations headquarters. The agent finds footage of Keener and his fellow rogue agents abandoning the LMB, with Tcherneko as their prisoner. The leader of the LMB, Charles Bliss, attempts to escape in a helicopter, but the agent destroys the vehicle, killing Bliss. Lau informs the agent that with most threats destroyed or weakened, New York is approaching stability, but an unknown signal leads the agent to a secluded laboratory. There, they find Dr. Amherst's remains, having discovered that he has died from exposure to his own virus. They also find a message from Keener, showing he has the technology to manufacture a new strain of Green Poison and intends to do so, and mysteriously tells the agent to explore the center of Manhattan, called the “Dark Zone.” The agent is informed that the information in the lab will further the development of a vaccine and is shown a recovered message from Amherst. In the message, Amherst reveals he engineered Green Poison as part of his eco-terrorist plan to decimate the human race and preserve the planet.","We live in a complex world.

Seed believes that he has been chosen to protect the people of Hope County from an ""inevitable collapse"" and has established a congregation called Eden's Gate. Ostensibly, this is to fulfill his mission of leading the people to salvation; in reality, Seed is a radical preacher and Eden's Gate is a militaristic doomsday cult. Under his rule, Eden's Gate has used both coercion and violence to forcibly convert the residents of Hope County, and intimidation to keep them from contacting the federal government for help. When an attempt to arrest Seed ends with the deaths of several lawmen, the player is swept into the armed conflict between Eden's Gate and the remaining Hope County residents who are organizing themselves into a resistance movement. The player takes on the role of a sheriff's deputy who is sent to Hope County to arrest Seed. Seed has assumed the title of ""the Father"" and maintains control over Hope County with the aid of his siblings, known as ""the Heralds"": Jacob, a former military officer that oversees their armed soldiers; John, a lawyer that has been able to acquire much of the land in Hope County for Eden's Gate; and Faith, who acts as a pacifist to bring the people to believe and trust in her older brother. The residents of Hope County opposed to Seed include Pastor Jerome, a local church leader that has seen his congregation taken by Eden's Gate; Mary May, a bartender whose father was murdered by the cult; and Nick Rye, a cropduster pilot who wants to eliminate the influence of the cult in order to build a better future for his children.","Welcome to Hope County, Montana, land of the free and the brave, but also home to a fanatical doomsday cult known as The Project at Eden’s Gate that is threatening the community's freedom.

According to Lord Emon later in the game, prior to entering the forbidden land Wander had stolen an ancient sword, which is the only weapon capable of slaying the colossi of the forbidden land. Led to the massive Shrine of Worship at the center of the region, Wander carries with him the body of a maiden named Mono. A moment later, several shadow-like creatures with humanoid forms appear and prepare to attack Wander, but he easily dismisses them with a wave of the ancient sword in his possession, which emits strong beams of light. After vanquishing the shadow creatures, the voice of the disembodied entity known as ""Dormin"" echoes from above, expressing surprise that Wander possesses the weapon. Wander requests that Dormin return Mono's soul to her body, which it states may be possible, but only if the sixteen idols lining the temple's hall are destroyed. It explains that this task can only be accomplished by using the ancient sword to kill sixteen colossi located throughout the land. Each contains a portion of Dormin's own essence, though this is not revealed until late in the game.  
  
Despite a warning from Dormin that he may have to pay a great price to revive Mono, Wander sets out to search the land for the colossi and destroy them. In a sequence after the eighth's slaying, a deterioration of Wander's body is shown clearly—his skin becoming paler, his hair darker, and dark streaks growing across his face. After the death of the twelfth colossus, it is revealed to the player that Wander is being pursued by a group of warriors led by Emon.  
  
Urged to hurry with his task by Dormin, Wander soon heads off to defeat the sixteenth and final colossus. On the way to this confrontation, he travels on horseback across a long bridge, which begins to collapse as he is halfway across. As Agro jumps over the last gap in the bridge, the portion which is landed on begins to separate from its foundation, causing Agro to nearly lose footing. Sensing the impending fall, Agro jerks forward to throw Wander to safety on the other side, making a sacrifice for him and falling into the river hundreds of feet below as the bridge finally gives way. Wander goes on to defeat the final colossus, and Emon's company arrives in the Shrine of Worship just as the last temple idol crumbles; Wander appears soon afterwards, his eyes and skin now both entirely pale, and two small horns protruding from his head. Declaring that Wander has been ""possessed by the dead"", Lord Emon orders his warriors to kill him. While he struggles to reach Mono, one warrior shoots Wander in the leg with a crossbow, while another stabs him through his heart with a sword. Black blood sprays from the wound as Wander's body becomes covered in darkness and falls to the floor—a death identical to those suffered by the colossi.  
  
Afterward, Dormin's spirit possesses Wander's body, transforming it into a shadowy giant. Dormin, now speaking in its masculine voice, explains that it had been separated to sixteen pieces—the colossi—to seal away its power, and that by entering Wander, who absorbed physical form from defeating each colossus, it is now whole again. While his men flee, Lord Emon casts the ancient sword into a small pool at the back of the temple's hall, creating a whirlwind of light that consumes Dormin and Wander. Emon and his men flee the forbidden land as the bridge connecting to the temple collapses behind them. As they safely arrive at the entrance to the forbidden land, Emon expresses hope that if Wander survived, someday he may be able to atone for his crimes.  
  
In the temple, Mono awakens, restored by Dormin in accordance with its agreement with Wander, and Agro limps into the temple with an injured hind leg. Mono follows Agro to the pool into which Wander and Dormin were pulled by Emon's spell, finding a male infant with tiny horns on his head.

Abstergo intends to put Desmond in the device to recall the memories of his ancestor, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, a member of the Assassin Brotherhood in the year 1191, who lived during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land. Initially, Desmond has trouble adjusting to the device, but eventually relives Altaïr's exploits over the next several days. The game then primarily changes to Altaïr's point-of-view, with occasional transitions to Desmond, due to problems with the Animus or onset of the Bleeding Effect. 
 
The game opens with Desmond entering Altaïr's memory, but he soon faces synchronization problems. On this, Lucy Stillman and Warren Vidic's voices can be heard, arguing over Desmond's safety within the Animus. After experiencing a few problems, Desmond exits the virtual machine and Vidic briefs him about the Animus' inner workings, before initializing the machine's tutorial program. After Desmond is done with the tutorial, he enters the closest synchronizable memory of Altaïr; Lucy adds that Desmond has to relive key moments of Altaïr's life to increase his synchronization, before reaching the final memory which holds the information that Abstergo is seeking. 
 
Altaïr is first shown attempting to retrieve one of a series of artifacts known as the ""Pieces of Eden"" from Solomon's Temple with the help of Malik Al-Sayf, and his brother Kadar, but they are stopped by Robert de Sablé, Grand Master of the Knights Templar and sworn enemy of the Assassins. While retrieving the treasure, Altaïr breaks all three tenets of the Assassins' Creed in an attempt to kill Robert, but he ultimately fails. In the following commotion, Malik's brother is killed, and Malik's left arm is crippled and later amputated. When Altaïr returns to the Assassins' stronghold at Masyaf with apologies, Malik, who survived de Sablé, comes back with the artifact and disparages Altaïr because of his arrogance. 
 
After narrowly defeating a retaliatory attack by the Templars, Al Mualim, leader of the Assassins, demotes Altaïr to a novice but gives him another chance to rise through the ranks of the Brotherhood. Al Mualim assigns Altaïr the task of assassinating nine key figures across the Holy Land in Jerusalem, Acre and Damascus, aiming to bring peace between the Crusader and Saracen forces. Each target is based on an actual historical figure from the Third Crusade, including Majd Addin, Garnier de Naplouse, Jubair al Hakim, Abu'l Nuqoud, Sibrand, William of Montferrat, and Robert de Sablé. 
 
Altaïr completes each task, learning how each target is connected to Robert and the Templars and how together they aim to end the Crusades and place the Holy Land under their own control. With men on both sides killed, he discovers that Robert's last plot is to attempt to unite the Christian and Muslim forces against their new common enemy, the Assassins themselves. Altaïr defeats de Sablé before Richard the Lionheart, failing to convince the King that an end to the war would be welcome to both sides, but ending Robert's plot. From de Sablé, Altaïr discovers that Al Mualim was himself a member of the Templars and used the Assassin to kill the other members who held the secret to the treasure's power, so that he could selfishly keep the artifact for himself. 
 
Altaïr quickly returns to Masyaf and approaches his master, who reveals the truth to him: the Piece of Eden, which he had recovered through the help of Altaïr directly before his transgression, creates illusions. He denounces religion and other seemingly supernatural events (e.g. the Ten Plagues of Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the presence of the Greek Gods in the Trojan War) as illusions caused by the Piece, and then states his intention to use the artifact to compel mankind into a brainwashed state, and in doing so, bringing an end to all conflict; Altaïr is eventually able to see through the deceptions created by the artifact to kill Al Mualim. When Altaïr recovers the artifact, the Piece of Eden activates, showing a holographic view of the world with numerous locations of other Pieces of Eden marked across the globe. 
 
When the process is complete, Desmond learns that Abstergo is a modern-day front of the Templars, and they are already seeking other artifacts at locations identified in Altaïr's memories. Further, he learns that the modern-day Assassins had tried to rescue him before the memory had completed but had failed. Following this, Desmond was to be killed after an order from a high-ranking Templar, Alan Rikkin, but Lucy Stillman saves him from death and, at one point, tucks her ring finger into her palm, referring to the Assassins' tradition of cutting off the finger. 
 
Though Desmond remains trapped in the Abstergo laboratory, his experience in the Animus has created a Bleeding Effect of Altaïr's life in his own, allowing Desmond to use Altaïr's Eagle Vision, which, in turn, allows him to see strange messages painted on the walls of his room and the floor of the lab. The messages all deal with various forms of the end of the world from different cultures, including several references to 21 December 2012, the date that Abstergo plans to launch a satellite that will ""permanently end the war.""

The game is set in the fictional American city of Lost Heaven (loosely based on New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago of the same time period). 
 
The player takes the role of taxi driver Thomas ""Tommy"" Angelo, who, while trying to make a living on the streets of Lost Heaven as a taxi cab driver, unexpectedly and unwillingly becomes involved in organized crime as a driver and enforcer for the Salieri crime family, led by Don Ennio Salieri.","Thomas ""Tommy"" Angelo, a taxi driver living in the 1930s in Lost Heaven (based on San Francisco and Chicago), enters a mafia gang led by Don Salieri and gets mixed up in a storyline including many plots, robberies and assassinations, later deciding to become an informant against the mob. Driven by third-person gunplay, realistic driving mechanics and advanced graphics, Mafia immerses the player into a real-world mobster story. 
 
Mafia contains a much bigger city to explore than most video games of the time, with multiple forms of available transport in addition to an expansive countryside.

If you only could get your hands around a plasma rifle or even a shotgun you could take a few down on your way out. Whatever killed your buddies deserves a couple of pellets in the forehead.

It is the semi-sequel to 2009's Wolfenstein, however utilizes very little from the game and drops any direct references to veil or supernatural. 
 
To progress through the story, the player battle enemies throughout levels. The game utilizes a health system in which players' health is divided into separate sections that regenerate; if an entire section is lost, the player must use a health pack to replenish the missing health.

For years, many of the magical lands described in myth, legend, and folklore (known as The Homelands) have been occupied by an enigmatic tyrant known as the Adversary. To escape the Adversary's totalitarian regime, many of The Homelands inhabitants fled to colonial America, and created an enclave known as Fabletown, now located in modern-day Manhattan. To mask their presence from the native humans, all non-human fables have to purchase an enchantment known as a ""glamour"" which allows them to appear human, or be relocated to a rural community known as ""The Farm"".

Flashbacks reveal that he was once a successful captain in the Spartan army and led his men to several victories before being defeated by a barbarian king. Facing death, Kratos called on the God of War, Ares, whom he promised to serve if the god would spare his men and provide the power to destroy their enemies. Ares agreed and bonded the Blades of Chaos, a pair of chained blades forged in the depths of Tartarus, to his new servant. Kratos, equipped with the blades, then decapitated the barbarian king.[23] 
 
Kratos waged war at the behest of Ares, eventually leading an attack on a village occupied by worshipers of Athena. Ares had secretly transported Kratos' wife and child to the village; during his frenzied attack on its temple, Kratos accidentally killed them. Although Ares believed this act would free Kratos to become the perfect warrior, the Spartan instead renounced his pledge of servitude to the god. The oracle of the destroyed village cursed Kratos by bonding the ashes of his dead family to his skin, turning it ash-white and earning him the nickname, ""Ghost of Sparta"". Plagued by nightmares of his horrible deed, Kratos vowed to serve the other gods in hope of ridding himself of the visions.","Similar to franchises like Devil May Cry, Rygar, and Castlevania, the game draws its inspiration from ancient Greek mythology and boasts a heavy emphasis on exploration and battle strategy. Broken into three to four acts, the game also has a strong focus on story-telling and boast tons of magic spells and abilities. Described as ""Clash of the Titans meets Heavy Metal"", God of War equips its hero with a pair of sword-like chain weapons that can grab enemies, perform multi-hit combos, and pull off a variety of different aerial attacks.

Each story concerns a World War II soldier overcoming insurmountable odds in the war.,"Call of Duty 2 is a first-person shooter that has a single-player story mode and a multiplayer mode. The player takes on the roles of several Allied protagonists in specific missions during World War II. The player can crouch and lie prone, and is able to scale low walls and other obstacles. Two firearms can be carried, which can be swapped with those left on the battlefield, and both fragmentation and smoke grenades can also be carried. A gun's iron sights can be used to aim more accurately. A compass on the heads-up display (HUD) shows both allies and enemies, and objective markers to indicate locations the player must reach, areas to defend, or enemy cannons or tanks that the player must plant explosives on to disable.    
   
Emplaced weapons such as machine guns and flak cannons are available in some locations to take out enemy troops. In addition, some missions place the player in control of a tank.","Any[1, 22, 39, 268435461, 536870914, 536870931, 536870937, 536870959, 536871036, 536871041, 536871213, 536871365, 536871436, 536871452, 536871470, 536871474, 536871475, 536871572, 536871707, 536871931, 536872010, 536872019, 536872070, 536872098, 536872205, 536872245, 536872315, 536872352, 536872375, 536872622, 536872712, 536872733, 536873111, 536873362, 536873454, 536873753, 536873767, 536873878, 536874552, 536874743, 536874813, 536874822, 536874834, 536874900, 536874906, 536874947, 536875046, 536875058, 536875059, 536875073, 536875081, 536875091, 536875095, 536875110, 536875122, 536875137, 536875158, 536875192, 536875194, 536875199, 536875216, 536875229, 536875242, 536875244, 536875248, 536875252, 536875253, 536875254, 536875257, 536875262, 536875265, 536875271, 536875275, 536875276, 536875286, 536875287, 536875303, 536875305, 536875312, 536875340, 536875342, 536875344, 536875358, 536875435, 536875436, 536875464, 536875483, 536875491, 536875492, 536875494, 536875503, 536875506, 536875507, 536875511, 536875525, 536875537, 536875542, 536875545, 536875546, 536875547, 536875549, 536875607, 536875624, 536875642, 536875649, 536875650, 536875662, 536875689, 536875693, 536875743, 536875781, 536875792, 536875798, 536875802, 536875803, 536875804, 536875806, 536875808, 536875810, 536875811, 536875817, 536875822, 536875830, 536875837, 536875901, 536875902, 536875908, 536875941, 536875949, 536876024, 536876083, 536876084, 536876097, 536876098, 536876108, 536876109, 536876128, 536876185, 536876219, 536876221, 536876222, 536876223, 536876235, 536876262, 536876287, 536876339, 536876367, 536876393, 536876395, 536876407, 536876415, 536876416, 536876419, 536876420, 536876432, 536876458, 536876466, 536876476, 536876499, 536876521, 536876545, 536876587, 536876603, 536876606, 536876621, 536876654, 536876663, 536876672, 536876687, 536876695, 536876701, 536876711, 536876750, 536876762, 536876800, 536876801, 536876812, 536876821, 536876853, 536876871, 536876899, 536876920, 536876922, 536876933, 536876938, 536876948, 536876980, 536876990, 536877049, 536877053, 536877108, 536877144, 536877152, 536877161, 536877173, 536877207, 536877208, 536877210, 536877212, 536877213, 536877217, 536877220, 536877226, 536877227, 536877231, 536877234, 536877239, 536877241, 536877264, 536877288, 536877307, 536877319, 536877324, 536877387, 536877409, 536877414, 536877443, 536877493, 536877532, 536877537, 536877542, 536877547, 536877555, 536877603, 536877605, 536877646, 536877801, 536877808, 536877815, 536877820, 536877928, 536877929, 536877938, 536877942, 536877950, 536877961, 536878003, 536878004, 536878015, 536878025, 536878027, 536878070, 536878104, 536878294, 536878327, 536878406, 536878427, 536878549, 536878566, 536878582, 536879028, 536879045, 536879087, 536879199, 536879604, 536879605, 536879606, 536879607, 536879608, 536879610, 536879613, 536879615, 536879616, 536879617, 536879618, 536879621, 536879622, 536879623, 536879624, 536879625, 536879626, 536879627, 536879633, 536879835, 536879870, 536879871, 536879882, 536879888, 536879958, 536880208, 536880223, 536880294, 536880360, 536880441, 536880442, 536880609, 536880619, 536880725, 536880765, 536880773, 536880807, 536880819, 536880896, 536881018, 536881293, 536881372, 536881378, 536881383, 536881504, 536881514, 536881516, 536881525, 536881529, 536881624, 536881981, 536881982, 536881995, 536882113, 536882274, 536882276, 536882329, 536882356, 536882362, 536882499, 536882908, 536883035, 536883067, 536883140, 536883141, 536883629, 536883819, 536884018, 536884021, 536884044, 536884125, 536884174, 536884503, 536884866, 536885528, 536885553, 536886215, 536887431]",Any[123],"Any[1, 2]",Null,"Any[1475, 1476]","Any[6, 12, 14]","Any[241, 569, 621, 623, 625, 949, 2031, 2033, 5647]",Call of Duty 2

The player's character begins on a sand dune in a seemingly endless desert. In the far distance looms a large, foreboding mountain with a glowing crevice that splits its peak. As the character approaches the mountain, they find remnants of a once-thriving civilization, eroded by sand over time. Scattered throughout the ruins at the end of each area are stones at which the traveler rests; these give the traveler the vision of meeting a larger, white-robed figure in a circular room, with art on the walls describing the rise and fall of the civilization, mirroring the player's journey.

The player continues to journey deeper into the remains of a once sprawling city at the base of the mountain. Eventually making it safely to the mountain, the traveler begins to climb it, struggling as they enter the colder climates and encounter deep snow and high winds. With the crevice still a fair distance away, the traveler falls and collapses in the snow. Six of the white-robed figures appear and grant the traveler new energy, allowing the player to reach the summit of the mountain and walk into and through the crevice as the screen fills with white. The player is then shown the game's credits, playing over the ending cinematic. This cinematic shows a shooting star emanating from the crevice and traversing the path the traveler took through the ruins, and shows glimpses of other robed travelers heading towards the mountain. Eventually, the star comes to rest at the sand dune where the game began, and the player is given the option of starting the game again. As the credits end, the player is shown the PlayStation Network IDs of the other travelers who shared part of the trek.","In Journey the player controls a robed figure in a vast desert, traveling towards a mountain in the distance. Other players on the same journey can be discovered, and two players can meet and assist each other, but they cannot communicate via speech or text and cannot see each other's names. The only form of communication between the two is a musical chime. This chime also transforms dull, stiff pieces of cloth found throughout the levels into vibrant red, affecting the game world and allowing the player to progress through the levels. The robed figure wears a trailing scarf, which when charged by approaching floating pieces of cloth, briefly allows the player to float through the air.

The developers sought to evoke in the player a sense of smallness and wonder, and to forge an emotional connection between them and the anonymous players they meet along the way. The music, composed by Austin Wintory, dynamically responds to the player's actions, building a single theme to represent the game's emotional arc throughout the story. Reviewers of the game praised the visual and auditory art as well as the sense of companionship created by playing with a stranger, calling it a moving and emotional experience. Journey won several ""game of the year"" awards and received several other awards and nominations, including a Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media nomination for the 2013 Grammy Awards.","Any[1, 268435463, 268435464, 268435468, 268435487, 268435488, 536871029, 536871208, 536871444, 536871529, 536871904, 536871939, 536872010, 536872349, 536872622, 536872961, 536873111, 536873249, 536873455, 536873712, 536874022, 536875083, 536875099, 536875151, 536875157, 536875194, 536875208, 536875271, 536875276, 536875322, 536875350, 536875437, 536875453, 536875610, 536875638, 536875695, 536875809, 536876015, 536876023, 536876069, 536876185, 536876229, 536876445, 536876540, 536876714, 536876751, 536876808, 536877057, 536877238, 536877384, 536877549, 536878284, 536878381, 536878488, 536878512, 536878531, 536879091, 536880854, 536880863, 536881002, 536881123, 536881414, 536882058, 536882159, 536882425, 536882616, 536883374, 536883375, 536883555, 536888127, 536890230, 536894294]",Any[174],"Any[1, 3]",Any[826],"Any[107802, 107803, 107804]","Any[6, 9, 39, 48]","Any[7344, 19150, 22387, 24426, 26226, 28309, 36198, 55190, 56033]",Journey

The game takes place two years after a global pandemic has killed almost everyone, but transformed millions of others into what survivors call Freakers – mindless, feral creatures, more animal than human but very much alive and quickly evolving. In the demo you saw two types of Freaks – Newts, which were adolescents when infected, are opportunistic hunters, preferring to hit and run from the shadows; and a Horde. Made up of hundreds of individual Freakers, Hordes eat, move and attack together, almost as one. Some Hordes roam the highways at night, while others, like the one in the demo, have found a food source that keeps it in a single location. Skills learned in his prior life as an outlaw biker have given Deacon a slight edge in the seemingly never-ending fight to stay alive.

Corruption is rampant, the drug trade is exploding, and murder rates are at an all-time high. In his fight to climb the ranks and do what's right, Phelps must unravel the truth behind a string of arson attacks, racketeering conspiracies and brutal murders, battling the L.A. underworld and even members of his own department to uncover a secret that could shake the city to its rotten core.","L.A. Noire is a neo-noir detective action-adventure video game developed by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games. It was initially released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms on 17 May 2011; a Microsoft Windows port was later released on 8 November 2011. 
 
L.A. Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed. 
 
The game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir—stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity—along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes for its in-game cases, based upon what was reported by the Los Angeles media in 1947. 
 
The game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as The Naked City, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.","Any[1, 20, 22, 33, 38, 268435487, 536870931, 536870932, 536870941, 536870984, 536871033, 536871041, 536871052, 536871127, 536871133, 536871157, 536871470, 536871506, 536871570, 536871577, 536871599, 536871670, 536871701, 536871784, 536871801, 536871889, 536871937, 536871945, 536872010, 536872019, 536872048, 536872070, 536872098, 536872100, 536872114, 536872205, 536872263, 536872285, 536872315, 536872352, 536872371, 536872511, 536872533, 536872581, 536872611, 536872695, 536872712, 536872715, 536872746, 536872873, 536872964, 536873192, 536873249, 536873364, 536873449, 536873712, 536873810, 536873878, 536874743, 536874813, 536874906, 536875006, 536875046, 536875050, 536875058, 536875059, 536875081, 536875089, 536875090, 536875094, 536875095, 536875098, 536875107, 536875110, 536875111, 536875112, 536875113, 536875130, 536875137, 536875154, 536875157, 536875178, 536875182, 536875197, 536875199, 536875216, 536875220, 536875225, 536875228, 536875229, 536875236, 536875242, 536875249, 536875251, 536875257, 536875269, 536875275, 536875286, 536875304, 536875308, 536875322, 536875325, 536875328, 536875340, 536875351, 536875358, 536875359, 536875360, 536875362, 536875364, 536875420, 536875437, 536875440, 536875455, 536875483, 536875492, 536875501, 536875502, 536875504, 536875506, 536875508, 536875509, 536875510, 536875518, 536875523, 536875525, 536875527, 536875534, 536875537, 536875538, 536875542, 536875546, 536875565, 536875623, 536875628, 536875635, 536875647, 536875649, 536875650, 536875700, 536875712, 536875729, 536875741, 536875743, 536875745, 536875747, 536875751, 536875781, 536875804, 536875808, 536875809, 536875819, 536875830, 536875837, 536875855, 536875868, 536875880, 536875886, 536875923, 536875957, 536876026, 536876066, 536876068, 536876069, 536876073, 536876083, 536876098, 536876108, 536876109, 536876128, 536876129, 536876130, 536876173, 536876179, 536876180, 536876183, 536876184, 536876210, 536876221, 536876258, 536876274, 536876276, 536876279, 536876289, 536876317, 536876333, 536876334, 536876338, 536876339, 536876344, 536876362, 536876363, 536876364, 536876384, 536876386, 536876389, 536876413, 536876418, 536876419, 536876434, 536876445, 536876454, 536876456, 536876460, 536876461, 536876476, 536876482, 536876502, 536876550, 536876569, 536876576, 536876616, 536876625, 536876650, 536876654, 536876659, 536876670, 536876672, 536876673, 536876679, 536876680, 536876682, 536876683, 536876701, 536876723, 536876765, 536876808, 536876811, 536876833, 536876912, 536876918, 536876988, 536877030, 536877109, 536877128, 536877150, 536877170, 536877171, 536877173, 536877176, 536877179, 536877181, 536877230, 536877238, 536877268, 536877305, 536877316, 536877325, 536877352, 536877384, 536877453, 536877541, 536877542, 536877578, 536877587, 536877604, 536877623, 536877648, 536877656, 536877657, 536877664, 536877671, 536877687, 536877704, 536877726, 536877864, 536877873, 536877882, 536877892, 536877903, 536877914, 536877953, 536877957, 536878029, 536878053, 536878055, 536878057, 536878058, 536878062, 536878063, 536878065, 536878080, 536878318, 536878320, 536878377, 536878437, 536878469, 536878565, 536879029, 536879030, 536879033, 536879073, 536879082, 536879110, 536879112, 536879117, 536879171, 536879175, 536879189, 536879208, 536879707, 536879715, 536879765, 536879766, 536879806, 536879912, 536879982, 536880094, 536880100, 536880278, 536880411, 536880622, 536880884, 536881103, 536881454, 536881599, 536881649, 536881997, 536882381, 536884109, 536885275, 536888127, 536888478, 536892269]",Null,Any[1],Null,"Any[4483, 19826, 19827, 19828, 19829]","Any[6, 9, 12]","Any[40, 960, 1020, 1342, 1906, 2993, 3188, 11270, 19441]",L.A.

However his wife died three years ago, and has kept the secrets surrounding her death. James decides to honor the letter's request, wondering if this is a sick joke or if there is more to this. As he reaches the outskirts of the town, James finds that the road is blocked, and parks at an abandoned restroom. Little does he realize that this is the first step forward into the mystery of Silent Hill and his own past.","Silent Hill 2 is the second installment in the Silent Hill survival horror series and the first game of the series to be released for Sony PlayStation 2. The gameplay is almost identical to the first game, which includes exploring Silent Hill with a flashlight and radio, while defeating monsters and solving puzzles along the way. Many of the environments are dark, and the flashlight is often the only source of light. For the first time in the series, the player can now block, even with a weapon.","Any[19, 21, 31, 43, 268435465, 268435487, 536870984, 536870991, 536871041, 536871043, 536871044, 536871071, 536871088, 536871109, 536871115, 536871133, 536871213, 536871251, 536871411, 536871470, 536871878, 536871944, 536871945, 536872032, 536872064, 536872105, 536872201, 536872225, 536872647, 536872715, 536872748, 536872815, 536872981, 536872983, 536872997, 536873082, 536873327, 536873364, 536873878, 536873904, 536873973, 536873999, 536874115, 536874398, 536874727, 536874745, 536874872, 536874873, 536875050, 536875081, 536875098, 536875157, 536875216, 536875229, 536875245, 536875249, 536875257, 536875271, 536875286, 536875330, 536875358, 536875364, 536875420, 536875437, 536875453, 536875456, 536875483, 536875493, 536875495, 536875502, 536875503, 536875504, 536875505, 536875523, 536875524, 536875535, 536875537, 536875538, 536875542, 536875572, 536875574, 536875621, 536875623, 536875639, 536875692, 536875731, 536875741, 536875760, 536875767, 536875792, 536875803, 536875808, 536875819, 536875830, 536875837, 536875868, 536875870, 536875893, 536875900, 536875934, 536875941, 536876014, 536876087, 536876088, 536876108, 536876125, 536876128, 536876168, 536876199, 536876221, 536876274, 536876287, 536876318, 536876323, 536876327, 536876332, 536876333, 536876414, 536876432, 536876445, 536876466, 536876511, 536876538, 536876587, 536876606, 536876631, 536876646, 536876647, 536876650, 536876665, 536876669, 536876850, 536876875, 536876919, 536876954, 536876982, 536877049, 536877151, 536877170, 536877173, 536877237, 536877238, 536877303, 536877319, 536877324, 536877383, 536877494, 536877501, 536877515, 536877560, 536877641, 536877704, 536877786, 536877802, 536877986, 536878005, 536878024, 536878066, 536878085, 536878096, 536878097, 536878226, 536878255, 536878304, 536878317, 536878400, 536879093, 536879233, 536879859, 536879895, 536879904, 536880198, 536880251, 536880285, 536880357, 536880845, 536880865, 536880888, 536881061, 536881087, 536881102, 536881113, 536881242, 536881248, 536881516, 536882025, 536882136, 536882493, 536882898, 536883035, 536883667, 536884023, 536884030, 536884456, 536884840, 536886885, 536886886, 536886887, 536886888, 536886889, 536886890, 536886891]",Null,Any[1],Null,"Any[99380, 99381]","Any[6, 8, 11]","Any[480, 482, 1009, 1906, 2031, 2939, 3188, 9727, 11270]",Silent Hill 2

The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. The main objective of each round is to clear 25 lines, after which the player moves on to the next round.

But when something strange draws you out of your lookout tower and into the world, you’ll explore a wild and unknown environment, facing questions and making interpersonal choices that can build or destroy the only meaningful relationship you have.","Firewatch is a mystery set in the woods of Wyoming, where your only emotional lifeline is the person on the other end of a handheld radio.

Samus can run, jump, crouch, and fire a weapon in eight directions; she can also perform other actions, such as wall jumping—jumping from one wall to another in rapid succession to reach higher areas. The ""Moon Walk"" ability, named after the popular dance move of the same name, allows Samus to walk backwards while firing or charging her weapon.

The game features interactive cutscenes which transition seamlessly into continuing gameplay; there are no loading screens across gameplay and cutscenes.","Any[1, 20, 33, 268435461, 536870933, 536870997, 536871033, 536871041, 536871133, 536871134, 536871213, 536871470, 536871506, 536871801, 536871937, 536872048, 536872070, 536872205, 536872211, 536872221, 536872245, 536872285, 536872315, 536872352, 536872581, 536872587, 536872622, 536872626, 536872695, 536872810, 536872862, 536872873, 536872883, 536872983, 536873053, 536873249, 536873352, 536873364, 536873753, 536873810, 536873889, 536873973, 536873999, 536874398, 536874706, 536874743, 536874916, 536874947, 536875046, 536875073, 536875081, 536875095, 536875098, 536875110, 536875114, 536875157, 536875158, 536875182, 536875192, 536875199, 536875209, 536875216, 536875228, 536875229, 536875249, 536875250, 536875265, 536875271, 536875275, 536875281, 536875288, 536875304, 536875326, 536875330, 536875332, 536875340, 536875358, 536875362, 536875396, 536875415, 536875417, 536875418, 536875433, 536875436, 536875437, 536875440, 536875453, 536875460, 536875483, 536875488, 536875491, 536875492, 536875494, 536875500, 536875501, 536875504, 536875506, 536875508, 536875510, 536875523, 536875527, 536875537, 536875538, 536875564, 536875565, 536875572, 536875583, 536875590, 536875623, 536875642, 536875650, 536875656, 536875668, 536875700, 536875728, 536875743, 536875745, 536875781, 536875792, 536875802, 536875803, 536875804, 536875808, 536875809, 536875813, 536875817, 536875818, 536875830, 536875832, 536875855, 536875868, 536875870, 536875880, 536875941, 536876029, 536876032, 536876068, 536876073, 536876083, 536876084, 536876097, 536876098, 536876099, 536876109, 536876125, 536876130, 536876175, 536876176, 536876179, 536876180, 536876181, 536876210, 536876221, 536876258, 536876261, 536876262, 536876273, 536876274, 536876275, 536876277, 536876322, 536876323, 536876332, 536876333, 536876338, 536876356, 536876362, 536876363, 536876364, 536876365, 536876419, 536876422, 536876423, 536876426, 536876434, 536876459, 536876469, 536876482, 536876505, 536876511, 536876520, 536876521, 536876529, 536876550, 536876569, 536876587, 536876596, 536876600, 536876616, 536876617, 536876626, 536876641, 536876648, 536876654, 536876666, 536876669, 536876687, 536876695, 536876703, 536876723, 536876724, 536876725, 536876808, 536876821, 536876833, 536876851, 536876853, 536876871, 536876875, 536876899, 536876968, 536876978, 536876987, 536877009, 536877028, 536877047, 536877049, 536877109, 536877128, 536877149, 536877157, 536877170, 536877176, 536877182, 536877226, 536877238, 536877239, 536877268, 536877278, 536877286, 536877302, 536877312, 536877319, 536877329, 536877346, 536877352, 536877373, 536877377, 536877383, 536877384, 536877451, 536877452, 536877490, 536877501, 536877502, 536877587, 536877605, 536877628, 536877648, 536877656, 536877664, 536877665, 536877713, 536877726, 536877741, 536877780, 536877802, 536877874, 536877907, 536877950, 536877970, 536878003, 536878004, 536878029, 536878032, 536878201, 536878265, 536878266, 536878270, 536878298, 536878304, 536878314, 536878396, 536878505, 536878584, 536879020, 536879023, 536879037, 536879042, 536879050, 536879062, 536879096, 536879117, 536879188, 536879220, 536879678, 536879707, 536879714, 536879718, 536879763, 536879870, 536879895, 536879957, 536879984, 536880286, 536880343, 536880640, 536880721, 536880785, 536880788, 536880901, 536880949, 536881020, 536881246, 536881277, 536881284, 536881586, 536881599, 536881621, 536881972, 536882006, 536882118, 536882545, 536882546, 536882770, 536882880, 536882943, 536883249, 536883865, 536884185, 536884417, 536884857, 536884858, 536884859, 536884860, 536884861, 536884862, 536889479, 536892082, 536892083, 536892084]","Any[26, 55]","Any[1, 2]",Any[9624],"Any[17932, 17933, 17934, 17935, 17936, 17937]","Any[6, 9, 12, 14]","Any[109, 1020, 1121, 1377, 2031, 3188, 5647, 11270, 19441]",Max Payne 3

In the beginning, set in Baku, Azerbaijan, Tombstone Squad—consisting of Recker, Dunn, Irish, and Pac—escapes the city, with vital intelligence in hand and Russian special forces in hot pursuit. The squad winds up trapped in a civilian's car when it plunges into the sea. Dunn, trapped between the seats and critically wounded, gives Recker his pistol and orders him to shoot out the windshield.[35] Reluctantly, Recker shoots the window, and Dunn drowns as the others escape. As Tombstone swims to the surface, the player hears their commanding officer, Captain Garrison, talking over the phone about the intel: that Admiral Chang is planning a military coup d'état, and if he succeeds, he will gain full Russian support, confirming an earlier report from an asset in China. Tombstone returns to the USS Valkyrie, an amphibious assault carrier en route to China's eastern coast. On board, Garrison informs them of the assassination of Chinese presidential candidate Jin Jié, and that Chang convinced the Chinese that the United States was responsible. 
Garrison sends Tombstone, with Recker as squad leader, on a covert mission in Shanghai to rescue three VIPs: Kovic, Hannah, and Hannah's husband. With Tombstone's help, Kovic takes his fellow VIPs to the Valkyrie by helicopter. Meanwhile, Tombstone takes a civilian tourist boat from the shore, just as an electromagnetic pulse fries all electric equipment in the area. Realizing that there are other civilian refugees stranded on boats around them, and against Pac's protests, Irish leads them to the Valkyrie. Aboard the Valkyrie, they head for the USS Titan, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier that can assist them. Upon sighting the Titan, the Valkyrie finds it highly damaged by Chang's Chinese military. Garrison orders Tombstone, with Kovic as acting squad leader (Recker lost the position because he didn't stop Irish in Shanghai), to scour the wreckage of the Titan for vital intelligence before it sinks. Tombstone recovers a hard drive with data from before the Chinese missile attack and fight their way out against boarding Chinese soldiers. The Titan buckles under its own weight while sinking and splits in two, forcing Tombstone to jump ship. Making their way back to the Valkyrie with a hijacked assault boat, they find the carrier under siege by Chinese forces. They board it to repel the Chinese assault. Kovic is critically injured during the engagement, and puts Recker back in charge of Tombstone before he dies. Tombstone then clears the bridge and rescues Hannah's husband and Garrison. 
Garrison debriefs Recker and Pac on the upcoming assault on the Chinese-controlled Singapore airfield to destroy Chinese air superiority while their air forces are grounded by a storm. Hannah volunteers to join Tombstone, much to Irish's chagrin, as he wasn't involved in the debrief himself. They successfully assault the beach and lead an advance towards the airfield, losing most of their forces in the process. While crossing a bridge to the airfield, Recker is pinned behind by a car blown by the strong winds and tries to break free with the help of Tombstone, to no avail. A large freighter crashes into the bridge, throwing Tombstone into the sea below. They survive and make their way to the airfield via a sewer. After Pac fires the signal flare, Tombstone attempts to evacuate the area using an enemy vehicle, but they are knocked out of their vehicle when the missiles hit, apparently killing Pac. Hannah seemingly betrays the squad, bringing the Chinese soldiers to capture Tombstone; this infuriates Irish, but neither he nor Recker can stop the soldiers from incapacitating them. 
Recker and Irish are then taken to a prison in the Kunlun Mountains by the Chinese military. There, the two Marines are interrogated about their mission in Shanghai, with Chang personally watching, before being thrown into cells. Recker is awoken by ""Dima"", a Russian prisoner suffering from radiation poisoning. Recker helps Dima release the other prisoners, starting a mass riot throughout the prison and reuniting him with Irish. Although the prison guard is overrun, Chinese military arrive and launch an assault. Recker and Irish hold them off long enough for Dima to open the prison gates, only to be caught by Hannah and other soldiers. Hannah shoots the soldiers holding Recker, Irish and Dima at gunpoint; she explains that she had been tasked to protect Jin Jié, who had been posing as her husband. The group fight their way through the Kunlun Mountains to a cable car, which goes down the mountain. The tram is then shot down by an enemy helicopter, and the impact kills Dima. 
Forced to continue on foot for two days, Tombstone makes their way down the mountain, forced to hunt for food to survive. They find a jeep and drive to Tashgar, under siege by both Chinese and Russian forces. While driving, Hannah explains that she'd brought Jin Jié to meet her family to give them hope, but that the next day, Chang's army came and killed them all; this mortifies Irish, and he apologizes to Hannah. They eventually find Major Greenland, who commands the remainder of U.S. ground forces in Tashgar. She states that the mobile anti-air that the Russians have are causing them to have a disadvantage. Tombstone volunteers to demolish the dam to flood the area, destroying the Chinese-Russian forces in exchange for a ride back to the Valkyrie. They successfully complete their task, and are sent to the Suez Canal. 
They are picked up by a U.S. C-130 using the Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, and are then paradropped to the Valkyrie, which is sailing blindly into Admiral Chang's forces. Tombstone assists in clearing the deck of boarding Chinese forces and find Garrison, who is holed up with Jin Jié, other survivors, and Pac (who had survived Singapore, and escaped by ""crawling through a thousand miles of shit with a hole in [his] stomach""). When Chinese forces finally reach the door to the medical bay, Jin Jié convinces Recker to let him show his face to the soldiers, as they had been fighting under the illusion that Jin Jié had been killed. Recker opens the door and is knocked down, but Jié calms the tension between the three forces showing his face to them. The Chinese soldiers celebrate the news of their leader's return and call off the attack. 
However, upon hearing this news, Chang barrages the Valkyrie with his warship, hoping to ""bury the truth and everyone with it"". With no ordinance to strike back, Recker, Irish and Hannah once again volunteer to manually destroy it with explosives. Driving a boat to the warship's blind spot, the trio set the remote charges and use grappling guns to bring them to safety under the Suez Canal Bridge before detonating the explosives. Unfortunately, the remote detonation fails, requiring manual replacement of the charges. Hannah volunteers to set a new charge, but Irish stops her, volunteering to do it himself because China will need Hannah. Recker—and the player—is forced to take two options: either do nothing as Chang's warship obliterates the Valkyrie, thus killing Pac, Garrison and Jin Jié; or to send either Hannah or Irish back down to set the explosives. As soon as the detonator lights green, Recker detonates the charges, destroying Chang's ship but killing whomever had gone down to make it possible. A U.S. rescue helicopter then picks up Recker and his remaining teammate, reporting to Garrison that one member is missing in action.

The Nephalem rescues Cain upon Leah's request and discovers that the fallen object is actually a person. The stranger has no memories except that he lost his sword, which was shattered into three pieces. Although the Nephalem retrieves the pieces, the witch Maghda seizes the shards and attempts to capture Cain to force him to repair the sword for her own ends. However, with an uncontrolled display of power, Leah forces Maghda to flee, and she kidnaps the stranger instead. Cain, dying from Maghda's torture, uses the last of his strength to repair the sword and instructs the Nephalem to return it to the stranger. The Nephalem rescues the stranger and returns his sword, causing him to regain his memories. The stranger then reveals himself as the fallen angel Tyrael. Disgusted with his fellow angels' unwillingness to protect humanity from the forces of Hell, Tyrael cast aside his divinity to become a mortal and warn Sanctuary about the arrival of the demon lords Belial and Azmodan. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To avenge Cain's death, the Nephalem tracks Maghda to the city of Caldeum, which is controlled by her master, Belial. The Nephalem kills Maghda, and rescues Leah's mother, Adria. Adria tells Tyrael and the Nephalem that the key to stopping the demons is the Black Soulstone, which can trap the souls of the seven Lords of Hell and destroy them forever. In order to obtain the Black Soulstone, the Nephalem resurrects the mad Horadrim, Zoltun Kulle. Kulle reveals its hiding place and completes the unfinished Soulstone, but is killed by the Nephalem after he attempts to steal it for himself. The Nephalem kills Belial and traps his soul within the Black Soulstone, freeing Caldeum. As Leah studies in Caldeum's library to find more answers about the Black Soulstone and Azmodan, she receives a vision from Azmodan, who tells her that he is sending an army from the ruins of Mount Arreat to take the Black Soulstone for himself. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tyrael, Adria, Leah and the Nephalem journey to Bastion's Keep, the only line of defense between Azmodan's forces and the rest of Sanctuary. With the others staying behind to protect the Black Soulstone, the Nephalem pushes out from the keep into Mount Arreat. The Nephalem kills Azmodan and traps his soul in the Black Soulstone. However, Adria betrays the Nephalem and takes the Black Soulstone with the seven Demon Lords' souls inside. She reveals that she has been Diablo's agent from the beginning, and that Leah's father is the Dark Wanderer, who conceived her while being possessed by Diablo, making her the perfect vessel for the demon's physical form.

Left to fend for herself, she has been forced to learn how to survive in a world gone mad. 
 
Many months have passed since the events seen in Season One of The Walking Dead, and Clementine is searching for safety. But what can an ordinary child do to stay alive when the living can be just as bad – and sometimes worse – than the dead? As Clementine, you will be tested by situations and dilemmas that will test your morals and your instinct for survival.","Similar to the previous season, The Walking Dead: Season Two is a point-and-click adventure game. The player, in control of Clementine, can direct the character around the environment, examine and interact with various scenery elements and collect and use objects to advance the story. The player can also initiate conversations with non-player characters via conversation trees. Certain replies from other characters may offer the player multiple choices to select from, including the option to stay silent, with a limited amount of time to make the selection; if the player does not select an option, the conversation will continue as if they had stayed quiet. Such choices can affect how the other characters will later react to Clementine which can influence later events in the story. Other scenes are more action-oriented, requiring the player to complete quick time events to avoid Clementine or her allies from getting killed. If the player fails these events, the game will restart at the start of such scenes. Such action scenes may also require the player to make a key decision within a limited time frame, such as which of two characters to save from attacking walkers.","Any[1, 19, 21, 31, 268435458, 268435465, 268435487, 536870917, 536870981, 536871029, 536871041, 536871133, 536871183, 536871470, 536871506, 536871776, 536871813, 536871878, 536871931, 536871939, 536872010, 536872032, 536872064, 536872070, 536872140, 536872211, 536872225, 536872315, 536872328, 536872419, 536872559, 536872587, 536872622, 536872626, 536872647, 536872695, 536872715, 536872746, 536872810, 536872843, 536872847, 536872983, 536873249, 536873326, 536873352, 536873362, 536873425, 536873590, 536874014, 536874452, 536874706, 536874813, 536874834, 536874906, 536874916, 536875046, 536875050, 536875054, 536875057, 536875059, 536875091, 536875096, 536875098, 536875101, 536875110, 536875112, 536875113, 536875114, 536875116, 536875131, 536875158, 536875182, 536875192, 536875199, 536875208, 536875216, 536875222, 536875228, 536875229, 536875231, 536875242, 536875244, 536875251, 536875254, 536875267, 536875271, 536875275, 536875287, 536875304, 536875315, 536875322, 536875328, 536875330, 536875331, 536875340, 536875342, 536875344, 536875358, 536875362, 536875394, 536875403, 536875420, 536875421, 536875436, 536875437, 536875438, 536875447, 536875454, 536875460, 536875480, 536875483, 536875486, 536875494, 536875497, 536875501, 536875502, 536875503, 536875504, 536875506, 536875507, 536875510, 536875511, 536875512, 536875513, 536875523, 536875524, 536875525, 536875526, 536875527, 536875530, 536875534, 536875536, 536875537, 536875540, 536875542, 536875543, 536875544, 536875545, 536875546, 536875549, 536875572, 536875623, 536875624, 536875637, 536875638, 536875639, 536875649, 536875650, 536875657, 536875692, 536875700, 536875741, 536875745, 536875747, 536875762, 536875767, 536875777, 536875786, 536875792, 536875804, 536875808, 536875809, 536875819, 536875830, 536875831, 536875852, 536875880, 536875893, 536875911, 536875932, 536875937, 536876008, 536876015, 536876029, 536876032, 536876049, 536876069, 536876074, 536876075, 536876083, 536876084, 536876090, 536876095, 536876097, 536876098, 536876108, 536876109, 536876122, 536876128, 536876129, 536876130, 536876172, 536876176, 536876178, 536876179, 536876180, 536876185, 536876188, 536876191, 536876240, 536876258, 536876275, 536876277, 536876287, 536876289, 536876302, 536876303, 536876304, 536876314, 536876317, 536876322, 536876325, 536876327, 536876332, 536876333, 536876338, 536876339, 536876342, 536876343, 536876344, 536876356, 536876357, 536876414, 536876420, 536876423, 536876434, 536876456, 536876461, 536876474, 536876483, 536876493, 536876498, 536876502, 536876511, 536876520, 536876545, 536876571, 536876577, 536876623, 536876625, 536876653, 536876665, 536876666, 536876669, 536876703, 536876705, 536876706, 536876722, 536876733, 536876769, 536876770, 536876812, 536876851, 536876880, 536876883, 536876890, 536876901, 536876923, 536876924, 536876972, 536876978, 536877128, 536877151, 536877170, 536877173, 536877253, 536877268, 536877303, 536877306, 536877315, 536877319, 536877320, 536877331, 536877332, 536877333, 536877334, 536877342, 536877349, 536877352, 536877366, 536877373, 536877377, 536877392, 536877394, 536877426, 536877501, 536877532, 536877587, 536877588, 536877604, 536877653, 536877688, 536877700, 536877741, 536877747, 536877750, 536877753, 536877804, 536877809, 536877835, 536877854, 536877864, 536877934, 536877956, 536877960, 536877965, 536877974, 536878101, 536878231, 536878259, 536878406, 536878426, 536878515, 536878554, 536878572, 536878582, 536878584, 536879025, 536879092, 536879131, 536879211, 536879233, 536879684, 536879864, 536879908, 536880046, 536880274, 536880413, 536880680, 536880682, 536881040, 536881066, 536881241, 536881500, 536881628, 536881663, 536882010, 536882011, 536882012, 536882013, 536890010, 536890011, 536890012, 536890013, 536893883, 536893884]",Any[12],Any[1],Null,Any[8768],"Any[6, 9, 12, 14, 39, 48, 49, 72, 130]","Any[533, 1906, 2031, 2939, 2993, 3188, 9498, 9727, 11270]",The Walking Dead: Season Two

It portrays a secret history of CIA clandestine black operations carried out behind enemy lines. Much of the campaign is told through the eyes of SOG and CIA operative Alex Mason, primarily through flashbacks. Mason awakens strapped to a chair in a room filled with monitors, bombarded with questions by two unknown interrogators about a numbers broadcast. Mason then recalls several events from the past in an attempt to answer their questions, setting up the missions of the game.","Call of Duty: Black Ops is the seventh main Call of Duty game and the sequel to Call of Duty: World at War. The game differs from most previous installments, which would involve a usual three-country campaign, while Call of Duty: Black Ops features two playable countries (Russia and the USA) but only has an American campaign. Several new features are also introduced, such as dive-to-prone and the available use of a flashlight on certain weapons. Furthermore, the campaign's playable characters now speak while being controlled by the player.","Any[1, 19, 21, 22, 39, 268435461, 536870913, 536870914, 536870917, 536870920, 536870933, 536870937,

Previously, Dubai was a wealthy area with many high profile citizens until catastrophic sandstorms left a majority of the city buried. This caused many to evacuate, leaving only a few behind. One of the people left behind was U.S. Army Colonel John Konrad (a reference to the author of Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad), a founding member of Delta Force, who refused to evacuate from a training facility in the city and instead remained behind with the men under his command to help protect the citizens that could not evacuate. 
 
After several weeks of no contact, the Army fears that Col. Konrad and his men are lost to the destruction of the city until a weak distress signal is picked up. This gives the Army reason to deploy the player and their squad, who must infiltrate the city, neutralize outlaws and survive sandstorms as they attempt to determine what happened to Konrad and his men.

After vanquishing the shadow creatures, the voice of the disembodied entity known as ""Dormin"" echoes from above, expressing surprise that Wander possesses the weapon. Wander requests that Dormin return Mono's soul to her body, which Dormin states may be possible on the condition that Wander can destroy the sixteen idols lining the temple's hall by using the ancient sword to kill each colossus the idols represent located throughout the land. Despite being warned by Dormin that he may have to pay a great price to revive Mono, Wander sets out to search the land for the colossi and destroy them.","Tales speak of an ancient land where creatures the size of mountains, roam the majestic landscape.

The flight recorder is being held aboard Sevastopol, a remote space station owned by the Seegson corporation, in orbit around the KG-348 gas giant. Samuels offers Ripley a place on the Weyland-Yutani team being sent to retrieve it so that she can have closure regarding the fate of her missing mother. Ripley, Samuels, and Weyland-Yutani executive Nina Taylor travel to Sevastopol on board the Torrens courier ship. The group arrives at Sevastopol to find the station damaged and its communications offline. They attempt to spacewalk over to the station to investigate, but their EVA line is severed by debris, and Ripley is separated from the others and forced to enter the station on her own. 
 
While exploring Sevastopol, Ripley finds the flight recorder of the Nostromo with no data and learns that the station is out of control due to a deadly alien creature lurking aboard. After regrouping with Samuels and Taylor, Ripley meets the station's Marshal, Waits, and his deputy, Ricardo. Waits explains that the alien was brought onto the station by Anesidora captain Henry Marlow, whose crew discovered the flight recorder near the LV-426 moon, where they also found a derelict ship previously found by the Nostromo crew and a nest of alien eggs contained within. While exploring the derelict, Marlow's wife was attacked by a facehugger. She was then brought aboard Sevastopol for emergency medical treatment, but died after a chestburster hatched from her. Waits convinces Ripley to contain the alien inside a remote module of the station. Although Ripley is successful, Waits ejects the module from the station with her still inside. As the module careens towards KG-348, Ripley space-jumps back to Sevastopol using a space suit. 
 
Ripley makes her way back to confront Waits, but Ricardo reveals that the station's service androids abruptly started slaughtering the remaining crew, including Waits. Samuels attempts to interface with the station's controlling artificial intelligence, APOLLO, to cease the rampage. However, the systems's defensive countermeasures kill him shortly after he opens a path for Ripley into APOLLO's control core. There, Ripley discovers that Seegson had been trying to sell off Sevastopol to Weyland-Yutani, who instructed APOLLO to protect the alien at all costs. Ripley tells APOLLO that the creature is no longer aboard the station and demands to cease all activity, but the system refuses, stating that ""scheduled reactor scans are unverified"". At the reactor, Ripley discovers an alien nest and initiates a reactor purge to destroy it. Ripley learns from Ricardo that Taylor was sent to retrieve the alien and that she freed Marlow in exchange for the location of LV-426. However, Marlow double-crossed her and took her hostage aboard the Anesidora. 
 
Aboard the Anesidora, Ripley discovers a message from her mother that was recorded after her initial report of the events on the Nostromo, thus finally giving Ripley closure. Marlow attempts to overload the fusion reactor of the Anesidora to destroy the station and ensure that no remaining alien creatures survive; Taylor kills him in attempt to reverse the process, but she herself is killed by the electric discharge, forcing Ripley to escape shortly before the Anesidora explodes. The explosion destroys Sevastopol's orbital stabilisers, causing the station to slowly drift into KG-348's atmosphere. Ripley and Ricardo contact the Torrens for extraction, but a facehugger latches on to Ricardo, forcing Ripley to leave him. After making her way outside to help the Torrens detach from the station, Ripley is surrounded by alien creatures and ultimately thrown into the ship by a blast. Aboard the Torrens, Ripley discovers that another alien has boarded the ship. When Ripley is cornered in the airlock, she ejects herself and the alien into space. Adrift in her space suit, Ripley is awakened by a searchlight.","Discover the true meaning of fear in Alien: Isolation, a survival horror set in an atmosphere of constant dread and mortal danger.

Now he is realizing that that battle has played out exactly as Master Xehanort had planned, and the second Keyblade War, the final struggle between light and dark, looms ahead. To counter the overwhelming darkness, Sora and his friends must gather the seven guardians of light. His best friend Riku and King Mickey seek out a battle-scarred Keyblade wielder, while Sora, Donald, and Goofy set off on a journey to find “the Key to Return Hearts.” Never-before-featured Disney worlds set the stage for another daring adventure to save the universe! 
 
Chosen by the Keyblade, he is the one whose heart’s light never fails to shine as a beacon of hope. 
 
Sora, the brave hero chosen by the Keyblade, has always had a strong sense of justice. Through his many battles against darkness, he has grown and learned about the world immensely. Drawn to his light, many friends have lent him their support and granted him their powers to counter the darkness: Riku, the childhood friend he grew up with on Destiny Islands; Donald and Goofy, the two brave comrades with whom he has shared his adventures from the very beginning; and King Mickey, who gives Sora his unfailing support. As the world becomes enveloped in another battle against darkness, the Keyblade wielder and his friends must rise up against Master Xehanort and thwart his plot to incite another Keyblade War.","Kingdom Hearts III is the third main installment in the Kingdom Hearts series developed and published by Square Enix. It was initially released January 2019 for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One. An expansion, Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind was released in January 2020. 
 
The story takes place after the events of Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance. It features an older Sora as the main protagonist, who sets forth on a new adventure to search for seven guardians of light in an attempt to stop Xehanort from bringing about a second Keyblade War. Sora is joined by Donald Duck, Goofy, Mickey Mouse, Riku, Kairi, and others. Along the way, Sora travels to many worlds from Disney and Pixar intellectual properties, and cross paths with the real Organization XIII. 
 
Kingdom Hearts III features hack and slash combat reminiscent of Kingdom Hearts II, with elements from later handheld entries, allowing the player to control Sora in a party with Donald, Goofy, and up to two other Disney characters from the various worlds he visits. A major addition compared is the Formchange mechanic, which allows his currently equipped Keyblade to grant him special abilities and change shape. Sora can equip up to three Keyblades at a time, and cycle between them to use his abilities. Another addition is the Attractions mechanic, which occasionally allows Sora to summon and pilot a vehicle inspired by Disney theme park attractions. At certain points throughout the game, the player will be able to control other characters.","Any[1, 17, 31, 35, 268435468, 268435481, 268435487, 536870990, 536871208, 536871557, 536871872, 536871938, 536871987, 536873066, 536873154, 536873384, 536873422, 536874398, 536874745, 536875011, 536875043, 536875073, 536875074, 536875081, 536875265, 536875437, 536875819, 536875830, 536875886, 536875934, 536876007, 536876208, 536876241, 536876329, 536876763, 536876976, 536877075, 536877129, 536877130, 536877131, 536877132, 536877133, 536877134, 536877135, 536877136, 536877137, 536877138, 536877139, 536877140, 536877598, 536879206]",Any[6],Any[1],Null,"Any[104175, 104177, 106720]","Any[48, 49]","Any[1864, 10760, 11169, 18812, 22387, 28168, 36198, 55038, 55199]",Kingdom Hearts III

The legend of the legendary hero's battles against Ganon has been passed down from generation to generation, and peace has ruled for decades. The game's incarnation of Link is an apprentice blacksmith to Hyrule's greatest Blacksmith. 
 
Beset by a nightmare of the sacred Triforce being destroyed and facing a gargantuan evil creature, Link is awakened from his sleep by Gulley, the Blacksmith's son. Link rushes over to the smithery, where the Captain of Hyrule's knights has stopped by to retrieve his sword and shield. After Link is scolded for being late, the Blacksmith's Wife notices that the Captain forgot to bring his sword along with him when he left. Link is tasked with traveling to Hyrule Castle to return it to its rightful owner. Once Link arrives at the castle however, he is told that the Captain went to the Sanctuary. Upon his arrival there, however, the villain Yuga appears, and turns both Seres and the Captain into paintings with his wicked magic. Link lunges at Yuga, but Yuga is able to use his magic to turn himself into a wall painting, causing Link to crash straight into the wall. Yuga then returns to his original form, kicking Link to the floor in the process. As Yuga leaves with Seres in tow, the Priest says to warn Princess Zelda of this before Link passes out.","The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is the first Zelda game made exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS is set in the fan-favorite world of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.

The castle is attacked by a gang of bandits named Salamandra, led by a criminal known as the Professor, a mage named Savolla who controls a large, praying mantis-like monster, and another mage named Azar Javed.

In this harsh fantasy world abstract, absolute and unconditional ideas such as “Good” and “Evil” written in upper case letters do not exist. Instead, however, while moral good exists , the protagonist will often only have a choice between two evils, deciding on the path which he regards as the lesser evil of the two. The game also features an innovative, time delayed decision-consequence system, prodding players to make their decisions seriously and with thought.","Any[1, 17, 268435468, 536871041, 536871059, 536871123, 536871134, 536871138, 536871139, 536871186, 536871208, 536871213, 536871422, 536871449, 536871504, 536871641, 536871758, 536871938, 536871945, 536872070, 536872092, 536872201, 536872225, 536872232, 536872234, 536872435, 536872626, 536872647, 536872793, 536872799, 536872810, 536872873, 536872883, 536872978, 536873364, 536873384, 536873580, 536873889, 536873949, 536873992, 536874398, 536874745, 536875042, 536875046, 536875050, 536875243, 536875253, 536875262, 536875271, 536875275, 536875281, 536875306, 536875331, 536875356, 536875372, 536875398, 536875432, 536875436, 536875453, 536875455, 536875485, 536875492, 536875494, 536875523, 536875531, 536875556, 536875614, 536875657, 536875699, 536875760, 536875762, 536875764, 536875767, 536875781, 536875791, 536875792, 536875868, 536875891, 536875895, 536875930, 536875941, 536875944, 536875952, 536876007, 536876032, 536876121, 536876174, 536876266, 536876270, 536876281, 536876333, 536876335, 536876392, 536876490, 536876503, 536876505, 536876569, 536876570, 536876571, 536876595, 536876726, 536876814, 536876840, 536876910, 536877032, 536877047, 536877207, 536877209, 536877289, 536877434, 536877453, 536877519, 536877559, 536877565, 536877763, 536877769, 536877770, 536877816, 536877965, 536878009, 536878132, 536878292, 536878328, 536878335, 536878349, 536878354, 536878382, 536878445, 536878508, 536878515, 536879059, 536879062, 536879105, 536879109, 536879114, 536879742, 536879859, 536879882, 536879958, 536880294, 536880682, 536880709, 536880920, 536881009, 536881025, 536881122, 536881347, 536881790, 536882362, 536882498, 536883229, 536883238, 536883370, 536883415, 536883968, 536883970, 536883988, 536883995, 536884018, 536884021, 536884022, 536885416, 536885932, 536886710, 536886902, 536886903, 536886904, 536886905, 536886906, 536886907, 536886908]",Any[68],Any[1],Null,"Any[498, 14532]","Any[6, 14]","Any[6, 76, 472, 478, 660, 1887, 1942, 3025, 9938]",The Witcher

The brothers are moved individually by two thumbsticks on the controller. The controller triggers also cause the respective brother to interact with the game world, such as talking to a non-player character or grabbing onto a ledge or object. 
 
The older brother is the stronger of the two and can pull levers or boost his younger brother to higher spaces, while the younger one can pass between narrow bars. The player progresses by manipulating the two brothers at the same time to complete various puzzles, often requiring the player to manipulate both brothers to perform differing functions (such as one distracting a hostile non-player character while the other makes their way around).

During the battle the Prince seeks to win honour and glory in his first battle and heads straight to the Maharajah's treasure vaults, where he discovers the mythical Sands of Time safely contained within their Hourglass and the Dagger of Time, which he quickly learns can turn back time a short amount. When the Prince presents the dagger to his father, the traitorous Vizier demands it as payment, but is refused by King Sharaman. The Persians then continue on their journey to Azad with the wealth of prisoners taken from the Maharajah, among them the Maharajah's beautiful daughter, Princess Farah. 
 
In Azad, the Vizier, now in the service of King Sharaman, tricks the Prince into using the Dagger to release the Sands of Time from the Hourglass. A horrific sandstorm engulfs the kingdom and the Sands of Time turn all the occupants of the palace into monsters. Only the Prince, Farah, and the Vizier remain unchanged due to their possessions; a dagger, a medallion, and a staff, respectively. Amid the catastrophe, the Vizier demands the dagger from the Prince, who refuses and manages to escape. 
 
The Prince soon teams up with Farah in an attempt to return the Sands of Time to the Hourglass, which the Vizier moves to the top of the Tower of Dawn. As they progress through the palace the pair are constantly waylaid by Sand Monsters (including a sand-possessed King Sharaman) and the deadly network of traps set in motion in the hopes of killing the creatures. The Prince becomes steadily more worn until his princely armor is mere shreds and his body covered in bloody wounds. 
 
While initially the Prince does not trust Farah because of the Persians' mistreatment of her, the two begin to grow closer as time goes on After a terrific battle in the ascent of the Tower of Dawn, they reach the Hourglass and are about to complete their mission when the Prince hesitates, suddenly suspicious of what Farah's motives really are. Before Farah can convince the Prince otherwise, the Vizier confronts the pair and uses his magical powers to trap Farah and the Prince in a tomb. 
 
As they wait to die in the tomb Farah tells the Prince, who similarly reveals his claustrophobia, a story she had never told anyone before, about a time when she was little, when her mother told her about a secret magic word which would help her escape anything that scared her: ""Kakolookia"". 
 
As soon as the Prince repeats the word, as if by magic, the Prince finds himself in a mysterious tunnel which winds down into a dreamlike bathhouse that resembles the magic fountains that the Prince earlier used to increase his health. There he meets Farah inviting him to join her bath; as they bathe, the Prince and Farah finally make love and find comfort in each other amid their perilous situation. When the Prince awakens afterwards, he finds himself back in the tomb and discovers that the magical cavern was just a dream, but he believed that Farah had shared it as well. However Farah, the Dagger, and his sword are gone, leaving him with only Farah's medallion to protect him from the Sands of Time. 
 
The Prince, having found a new sword which destroys the sand monsters on contact, pursues and catches up to Farah once more atop the Tower of Dawn, which he must climb from the outside. When the Prince finally reaches the top, he finds Farah being overwhelmed by the sand monsters and she dangles over a cliff by the Dagger, while the Prince grab the blade; and Farah, realizing that the Prince will die to save her, instead sacrifices herself and lets go of the Dagger; and true to the game's prophecy ""if you want to live, die in love"" she falls to her death in the Hourglass room below. The Prince then tries to use the dagger to save her, but finds the sand-tanks empty since Farah had used them all. Enraged by his lover's death, the Prince uses the Dagger to massacre the last of the sand monsters in the tower and descends to weep over Farah's body. As the Prince mourns, the Vizier emerges from the shadows and offers the Prince a partnership in his evil plan, promising him eternal life; however the Prince angrily refuses because those he loved had died, and before the Vizier can stop him, the Prince drives the Dagger of Time into the Hourglass, rewinding time to the night before the invasion of the Maharajah's kingdom. The Prince awakens, still with the Dagger of Time, and secretly finds his way to Farah's bedroom, where he tells her the whole story, which she does not remember as it had not happened yet. However, the Vizier discovers the Prince, and fearing his planned treachery already revealed, attempts to kill both Farah and the Prince, telling that he suffered from consumption and would die in any event and that his plan was to cure his imminent death with eternal life. In the ensuing battle the Prince kills the Vizier. He then returns the Dagger of Time to Farah, who asks why the Prince invented such an unbelievable story to prove the Vizier's treachery. The Prince then kisses Farah, hoping she'll remember; but she rebuffs his advance, and so the Prince uses the dagger to erase the kiss, and instead he falsely tells her that it was just a story. But when Farah asks the Prince his name, he replies, ""Just call me Kakolookia"", before departing, leaving Farah amazed.","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a third-person puzzle-platformer and action-adventure computer and video game published by Ubisoft. It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989. 
 
The Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards. 
 
The game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010). A remastered, high-definition, version of The Sands of Time was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on November 16, 2010.","Any[1, 268435464, 268435487, 536871049, 536871082, 536871088, 536871139, 536871208, 536871213, 536871301, 536871302, 536871470, 536871738, 536871758, 536871865, 536871945, 536872010, 536872070, 536872257, 536872961, 536873053, 536873067, 536873384, 536873674, 536874190, 536874209, 536874398, 536874943, 536875047, 536875050, 536875073, 536875081, 536875089, 536875092, 536875095, 536875101, 536875133, 536875157, 536875199, 536875242, 536875257, 536875301, 536875306, 536875405, 536875437, 536875453, 536875454, 536875456, 536875523, 536875531, 536875621, 536875638, 536875689, 536875693, 536875755, 536875760, 536875768, 536875778, 536875805, 536875819, 536875830, 536875840, 536875868, 536875902, 536875934, 536876006, 536876011, 536876199, 536876266, 536876351, 536876359, 536876476, 536876511, 536876545, 536876584, 536876599, 536876606, 536876611, 536876695, 536876703, 536876735, 536876755, 536876874, 536876881, 536876929, 536876987, 536877016, 536877047, 536877049, 536877056, 536877230, 536877294, 536877410, 536877628, 536877658, 536877659, 536877764, 536878256, 536878264, 536878387, 536878505, 536878507, 536878523, 536878600, 536879092, 536879123, 536879761, 536879764, 536879806, 536879894, 536879895, 536879992, 536880274, 536880294, 536880441, 536881716, 536882765, 536883035, 536883318, 536883319, 536883320, 536883321, 536883778, 536883870, 536883899, 536884027, 536884207, 536884472, 536884474, 536884494, 536885901, 536886180, 536886183, 536887250, 536887251, 536887252]",Any[76],Any[1],Null,"Any[1845, 2220, 2221]","Any[6, 8, 9, 11, 21, 24]","Any[127, 549, 551, 552, 837, 1331, 2437, 3025, 22565]",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time

The Global Relief Effort (GRE) assists survivors still trapped in the city by regularly airdropping supplies. The GRE hires Kyle Crane to infiltrate Harran in order to retrieve a sensitive file stolen from them by Kadir Suleiman, which he is using as leverage to blackmail them, with the threat of publicizing it if anything were to happen to him. Crane is airdropped into Harran, where he is ambushed by a gang of hostile bandits. As the infected attack, Crane is bitten and infected, but rescued by Jade Aldemir and Amir Ghoreyshi. Amir sacrifices himself to buy Jade and Crane time, and Jade takes him to a survivor sanctuary called the Tower. Crane wakes up and is introduced to Rahim Aldemir, Jade's brother. Rahim then teaches Crane parkour and sends him to Spike, who gives him his first task as a resident of the tower. Crane learns that the Tower, which seeks to help other survivors, is being harassed by a gang of bandits led by a warlord named Rais who steals and hoards the supplies from the GRE airdrops, including Antizin; a vaccine that suppresses symptoms of infection and keeps bitten people from turning into the infected. After Harris Brecken, leader of the tower is nearly killed by a rival runner in a mission to retrieve an Antizin drop, need for the drug becomes immense. Crane volunteers and manages to reach an airdrop containing Antizin, but despite the dire need of the vaccine by the survivors, Crane is instructed by the GRE to destroy the airdrop, instructing him to reach out to Rais in order to buy the vaccine in order to confirm his identity. Crane reluctantly complies and informs the Tower that the supplies have been looted. 
 
Upset, Brecken tasks Crane with the job of making a deal with Rais. Upon meeting Rais, Crane is able to confirm that he is indeed Suleiman. He carries out a series of unethical tasks for Rais under the assumption that he will be rewarded with two crates of Antizin. Crane is unable to locate the file, and is later betrayed by Rais, who only gives him five vials of Antizin. He later breaks off business with the GRE when they halt the supply drops and refuse to help the Tower. The situation in the tower worsens, and a whole floor is sealed off when an outbreak occurs. While doing an errand, Rahim tells Crane that he and Omar were planning to bomb an infected nest. Crane is opposed to this plan. After an argument over the radio, he gives chase to a fleeing Rahim. Upon catching up to him, he finds that Omar is dead, while Rahim has been wounded. He then executes Rahim's plans, resulting in the killing of the infected in the compound. When he gets back to Rahim he discovers that he was actually bitten and had turned while Crane was gone, forcing Crane to respectfully snap Rahim's neck when he attacks him. When Crane returns to the tower to inform Brecken of the news, Jade overhears them, and visibly upset, takes off. 
 
Meanwhile, a scientist at the Tower named Dr. Imran Zere, who was attempting to develop a cure for the virus, is kidnapped by Rais, prompting Crane to attempt a rescue mission. Crane is also captured by Rais, who reveals that the file he stole contains proof that the GRE intends to weaponize the virus rather than develop a cure and releases the file to the public. Crane manages to escape before being executed, resulting in Rais losing one of his hands during the process. Dr. Zere is killed in the rescue attempt, but manages to tell Crane that he had entrusted his research to Jade, who is tasked with delivering it to another scientist named Dr. Allen Camden. As Crane goes to look for Jade, he finds out that the Defense Ministry is planning to bomb Harran in an effort to completely eradicate the outbreak, claiming that there are no survivors left in the city. He manages to reactivate a radio tower and broadcasts a message to the outside world, thwarting the Ministry's plan. Jade was captured by Rais, who also steals Dr. Zere's research. Crane manages to rescue Jade and recover a part of Dr. Zere's research, but Jade admits that she has been bitten, and pleads with Crane to stop Rais. Jade then succumbs to the wound, forcing Crane to kill her. After killing Rais' assistant, Tair with his own machete, Crane delivers the tissue samples to Dr. Camden, who believes that he is very close to the cure, but needs the rest of Dr. Zere's data. Crane then finds out that Rais has cut a deal with the GRE, in which he will hand over Dr. Zere's research data to them in return for extraction from Harran. Crane then assaults Rais' headquarters (filled with infected) and battles him atop a skyscraper, eventually stabbing Rais in the neck and throwing him off the building. He recovers the research data and decides to turn it over to Dr. Camden instead of the GRE, intending to stay in Harran to help the survivors.","Dying Light is a first-person, action survival horror game set in a vast and dangerous open world. During the day, players traverse an expansive urban environment overrun by a vicious outbreak, scavenging the world for supplies and crafting weapons to defend against the growing infected population.

Players take control of the Kid, a silent protagonist who awakens on one of the few remaining pieces of the old world and sets off for the eponymous Bastion, where everyone was supposed to go in troubled times. The only survivor he meets there is an elderly man named Rucks, the game's narrator, who instructs him to collect the Cores that once powered Caelondia. A device in the Bastion can use the power of the crystalline Cores to create landmasses and structures, as well as enable the Kid to travel farther afield via ""skyways"" that propel him through the air. 
 
During his quest, the Kid meets two more survivors: Zulf, an ambassador from the Ura, underground-dwelling people with whom Caelondia was once at war; and Zia, an Ura girl who was raised in Caelondia. Both of them return to the Bastion, but upon reading a journal that the Kid discovers, Zulf intentionally damages parts of the Bastion's central device (the monument) and returns to Ura territory. The Kid learns that the journal belonged to Zia's father, Venn, who had worked for the Caelondians. He had helped Caelondian scientists (""Mancers"") build a weapon intended to destroy the Ura completely to prevent another war. Venn rigged the weapon to backfire, so that when he was finally forced to trigger it, the resulting Calamity destroyed most of Caelondia as well. 
 
To repair Zulf's damage to the Bastion, the Kid starts collecting Shards, a lesser form of Cores. As he obtains the penultimate shard needed, the Ura attack the Bastion, damaging it and abducting Zia. In the next seven days, The Kid engages in sporadic skirmishes in Ura territory. When he finally blasts through an Ura outpost and meets Zia, she tells him that she had left with the Ura voluntarily to find out their intentions; Rucks had previously told Zia that the Bastion had the ability to somehow fix the Calamity. The Kid travels to the once-underground Ura homeland to retrieve the last shard. There, he discovers Zulf being attacked by his own people: the battle with Kid has devastated the Ura forces, and they blame Zulf for bringing the Kid to their home. The Kid can choose to drop his weapon to help Zulf or leave him. If he leaves Zulf behind, the Kid destroys the remnants of the Ura and escapes through a skyway. If he chooses to carry Zulf, Ura archers initially open fire on them but ultimately cease fire and watch silently as the Kid and Zulf take the skyway back to the Bastion. 
 
After the Kid returns and recovers, Rucks gives him another choice: He can have the Bastion rewind time to before the Calamity in the hopes of preventing it, or use it to evacuate the survivors and move on to somewhere safe. Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as there was no way to test the process. The game ends either way, showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits. In the New Game+ mode, which is unlocked after beating the game once, it is hinted that restoring the world didn't prevent the Calamity.","A hack-and-slash RPG featuring a reactive narrator, various unlockable weapons, weapon upgrades, practice mini-games and optional difficulty modifiers, set in an imaginary world in the aftermath of an uncertain apocalypse, in which the player embodies a teenager with a troubled past as he and the narrator work together to rebuild the world out of a persisting hub called the Bastion.","Any[1, 17, 268435468, 268435488, 536870981, 536871086, 536871139, 536871208, 536871213, 536871307, 536871390, 536871422, 536871615, 536871738, 536871905, 536871938, 536871945, 536872070, 536872152, 536872205, 536872225, 536872229, 536872406, 536872862, 536873066, 536873326, 536874916, 536875046, 536875047, 536875062, 536875063, 536875072, 536875089, 536875095, 536875096, 536875131, 536875133, 536875185, 536875193, 536875196, 536875199, 536875293, 536875303, 536875304, 536875309, 536875358, 536875361, 536875407, 536875422, 536875432, 536875453, 536875492, 536875521, 536875531, 536875689, 536875695, 536875702, 536875744, 536875745, 536875755, 536875792, 536875904, 536876027, 536876033, 536876171, 536876174, 536876175, 536876191, 536876228, 536876430, 536876435, 536876453, 536876471, 536876555, 536876569, 536876577, 536876726, 536877014, 536877368, 536877429, 536877560, 536878257, 536878281, 536878314, 536878315, 536878382, 536878555, 536878597, 536879111, 536879917, 536880227, 536880256, 536880327, 536880547, 536880863, 536880943, 536881047, 536882034, 536882241, 536882413, 536882662, 536882694, 536882870, 536883101, 536883223, 536883471, 536883472, 536883473, 536883474, 536883475, 536883476, 536883477, 536883478, 536883479, 536883480, 536883481, 536883482, 536883483, 536883484, 536883485, 536883486, 536883487, 536883488, 536883489, 536883490, 536883491, 536883492, 536883493, 536883494, 536883495, 536883496, 536883497, 536883498, 536883499, 536883500, 536883501, 536883502, 536883503, 536883504, 536883505, 536883506, 536883507, 536883508, 536883509, 536883510, 536883511, 536883512, 536883513, 536883514, 536888822, 536888823, 536890043, 536890044, 536890045]","Any[103, 104]",Any[1],Null,"Any[69611, 97017, 97018]","Any[3, 6, 9, 12, 14, 39, 46, 48, 49, 130]","Any[1593, 1942, 2480, 3025, 9278, 9806, 9938, 11646, 26855]",Bastion

In the 21st century, a worldwide conflict is brought on by global petroleum shortage. Several nations begin warring with one another for the last of non-renewable resources, namely oil and uranium; known as the Resource Wars, fighting begins in April 2052 and ends in 2077. China invades Alaska in the winter of 2066, causing the United States to go to war with China and using Canadian resources to supply their war efforts, despite Canadian complaints. Eventually the United States violently annexes Canada in February 2076 and reclaims Alaska nearly a year later. After years of conflict, on October 23, 2077, a global nuclear war occurs. It is not known who strikes first, but in less than a few hours most major cities are destroyed. The effects of the war do not fade for the next hundred years and as a consequence, human society has collapsed leaving only survivor settlements barely able to make out a living in the barren wasteland, while a few live through the occurrence in underground fallout shelters known as Vaults. One of these, Vault 13, is the protagonist's home, where the game begins. 
 
In Vault 13, in 2161 in Southern California, 84 years after the nuclear war. The Water Chip, a computer chip responsible for the water recycling and pumping machinery, breaks. The Vault Overseer tasks the protagonist, the Vault Dweller, with finding a replacement. He or she is given a portable device called the ""Pip-Boy 2000"" that keeps track of map-making, objectives, and bookkeeping.

By making life or death decisions using the sophisticated ""butterfly effect"" system, everything you do will drastically alter the course of the story - and the fate of each character.","Until Dawn is an interactive drama survival horror video game. It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support, but in August 2014, the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive. 
 
Until Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the ""Butterfly Effect"" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player's choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has ""hundreds of endings"". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game. 
 
The gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls. 
 
Until Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story, mostly the second half, camera angles, character movements and partially linear plot.","Any[19, 21, 268435487, 536871045, 536871130, 536871838, 536871939, 536871944, 536871980, 536872032, 536872098, 536872225, 536872349, 536872587, 536872622, 536872628, 536872715, 536872788, 536872789, 536872964, 536873425, 536874182, 536874727, 536875057, 536875081, 536875095, 536875157, 536875159, 536875179, 536875229, 536875249, 536875250, 536875257, 536875287, 536875324, 536875328, 536875331, 536875342, 536875396, 536875453, 536875454, 536875483, 536875498, 536875513, 536875527, 536875540, 536875542, 536875549, 536875675, 536875678, 536875760, 536876072, 536876088, 536876189, 536876191, 536876228, 536876229, 536876277, 536876359, 536876418, 536876577, 536876650, 536876669, 536876735, 536876797, 536876814, 536876817, 536876896, 536876901, 536876924, 536877122, 536877170, 536877183, 536877344, 536877499, 536877653, 536877664, 536877828, 536877964, 536877974, 536878064, 536878133, 536878515, 536879231, 536880016, 536880567, 536885987, 536885988, 536889440, 536890191, 536890192, 536890193]",Any[412],Any[1],Null,"Any[25340, 55820]",Any[48],"Any[1009, 1342, 2939, 3188, 4786, 7342, 9727, 11270, 19562]",Until Dawn

As one progresses through the six worlds in Braid, storyline text at the beginning of each world provides further insight into Tim's quest for the princess, and alludes to the overarching gameplay mechanic of each level. The themes evoked include forgiveness, desire, and frustration. The final level, in which everything but Tim moves in reverse, depicts the princess escaping from a knight, and working together with Tim to surpass obstacles and meet at her home. Tim is suddenly locked out of the house, and, as time progresses forward, reversing Tim's actions, the events show the princess running from Tim, setting traps that he is able to evade, until she is rescued by the knight. Tim is revealed to be the ""monster"" the princess is running from. 
Following completion of the game, the player finds additional texts that expand the story. The ending of the game is purposely ambiguous, and has been subject to multiple interpretations. One theory, based on the inclusion of a hidden event and the famous quotation stated by Kenneth Bainbridge after the detonation of the first atomic bomb—""Now we are all sons of bitches""—is that the princess represents the atomic bomb and Tim is a scientist involved in its development.[20] Some also refer to the name of the game as both reference to the hair braid of the princess Tim seeks as well as the intertwining of time, demonstrated by the various time mechanics explored in the game. Journalists have considered Braid's plot to be interwoven with the game itself, much as the book Dictionary of the Khazars and the films Memento and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind interweave the narrative into the work's construction. In this sense, some have considered the game to carry a simple credo, such as ""You must look back to go forwards"" as suggested by Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead. Others have likened Braid to punk rock, designed (as explicitly stated by Blow) specifically as a statement against the status quo of the industry; it is considered to deconstruct traditional gameplay concepts, such as jumping on enemies or rescuing a princess from a castle as borrowed from Super Mario Bros., and rebuild them in the game to force the player to rethink current game design. Blow has stated that there is more than one interpretation of the story; he ""would not be capable"" of explaining the whole story of the game in words, and said that the central idea is ""something big and subtle and resists being looked at directly.""Blow considered Braid to be ""about the journey, not the destination"". He deliberately designed the plot not to be fully revealed to the player unless they completed the game, seeing it as a way to provide ""a longer-term challenge"".","Braid is a puzzle-platformer, drawn in a painterly style, where you can manipulate the flow of time in strange and unusual ways. From a house in the city, journey to a series of worlds and solve puzzles to rescue an abducted princess. In each world, you have a different power to affect the way time behaves, and it is time's strangeness that creates the puzzles. The time behaviors include: the ability to rewind, objects that are immune to being rewound, time that is tied to space, parallel realities, time dilation, and perhaps more. 
 
Braid treats your time and attention as precious; there is no filler in this game.

As the XCOM commander, you will defend against a terrifying global alien invasion by managing resources, advancing technologies, and overseeing combat strategies and individual unit tactics. 
The original XCOM is widely regarded as one of the best games ever made and has now been re-imagined by the strategy experts at Firaxis Games. XCOM: Enemy Unknown will expand on that legacy with an entirely new invasion story, enemies and technologies to fight aliens and defend Earth.

The Chief, Johnson, and company fight Covenant in the jungle and arrive at a UNSC outpost. Here, Keyes and Lord Hood plan a final effort to stop the Covenant leader, the High Prophet of Truth, from activating a Forerunner artifact uncovered outside the ruins of the city of New Mombasa. The Chief clears anti-air Covenant defenses so Hood can lead the last of Earth's ships against the Prophet, but Truth activates the buried artifact, creating a slipspace portal which he and his followers enter. A Flood-infested ship crash-lands nearby; Elite forces arrive and vitrify Flood-infected areas of Earth, stopping the threat. Following a message Cortana left aboard the Flood ship, the Chief, Arbiter, Elites, Johnson, Keyes and their troops follow Truth through the portal. Joining them is 343 Guilty Spark, who aids the Chief as he has no function to fulfill after the destruction of his ringworld. 
Traveling through the portal, the humans and Elites discover an immense artificial structure known as the Ark, far beyond the edges of the Milky Way galaxy. Here, Truth can remotely activate all the Halos. The Flood arrive aboard High Charity in full force, beginning to infest the installation. Truth captures Johnson, as he needs a human to use Forerunner technology. Keyes is killed attempting a rescue, and Johnson is forced to activate the rings. Gravemind forges a truce with the Chief and Arbiter to stop Truth. The Arbiter, Master Chief, and Flood forces arrive and overwhelm Truth's guards, rescuing Johnson and halting the installations' activation. After the Arbiter kills Truth, Gravemind turns on the Chief and Arbiter. 
The Chief, Arbiter and Guilty Spark discover that the Ark is constructing another Halo to replace the one that the Chief previously destroyed. The Chief decides to activate this Halo; the ringworld would eliminate the Flood infestation on the Ark while sparing the galaxy at large from destruction. To activate the ring, the Chief rescues Cortana, who has the Activation Index of the destroyed Halo, from High Charity and destroys the city. Arriving on the new Halo, Cortana warns that Gravemind is trying to rebuild itself on the ring. The Chief, Arbiter, and Johnson travel to Halo's control room to activate the ring. Guilty Spark explains that because the ring is not yet complete, a premature activation will destroy it and the Ark. When Johnson ignores his warning, Guilty Spark fatally wounds him to protect ""his"" ring. The Chief destroys Guilty Spark, activates the ring, and escapes the ring's self-destruction on the UNSC frigate Forward Unto Dawn. However, the force of Halo's blast causes the slipspace portal to collapse, resulting in only the front half of Forward Unto Dawn, carrying the Arbiter, making it back to Earth. 
A memorial service is held on Earth for the fallen heroes of the Human-Covenant war, during which the Arbiter and Lord Hood briefly exchange words regarding the fallen Master Chief. After the memorial service, the Arbiter and his Elite brethren depart for their home planet, Sanghelios. Meanwhile, the rear half of the Forward Unto Dawn drifts in unknown space. Cortana drops a distress beacon, but acknowledges it may be many years before they are rescued. The Chief enters cryonic sleep, telling Cortana to ""wake me, when you need me."" If the game is completed at the Legendary difficulty level, the scene continues to show the piece of Forward Unto Dawn drifting towards an unknown planet, revealed in the sequel to be known as ""Requiem"", the primary setting of the campaign of Halo 4.","Halo 3 is a shooter game where players primarily experience gameplay from a first-person perspective. Much of the gameplay takes place on foot, but also includes segments focused on vehicular combat. The balance of weapons and objects in the game was adjusted to better adhere to the ""Golden Triangle of Halo"": these are weapons, grenades, and melee attacks, which are available to a player in most situations. Players may dual-wield some weapons, forgoing the use of grenades and melee attacks in favor of the combined firepower of two weapons. Many weapons available in previous installments of the series return with minor cosmetic and power alterations. Unlike previous installments, the player's secondary weapon is visible on their player model, holstered or slung across the player's back. 
Halo 3 introduces ""support weapons"", which are cumbersome two-handed weapons that slow the player, but offer greatly increased firepower in return. In addition to weapons, the game contains a new class of gear called equipment; these items have various effects, ranging from defensive screens to shield regeneration and flares.

Thrown together as unwilling partners in an adventure to recover cash they both think is theirs, their journey will take you on a wild ride where gangsters, bandit lords, and Vault Hunters are just some of the obstacles you’ll encounter, in this new take on the award-winning universe created by Gearbox Software.","Any[1, 18, 27, 268435487, 536870969, 536870979, 536871041, 536871079, 536871139, 536871262, 536871475, 536871487, 536871506, 536871570, 536871878, 536871882, 536871939, 536872064, 536872070, 536872098, 536872205, 536872257, 536872335, 536872594, 536872622, 536872651, 536872843, 536872898, 536873024, 536873053, 536873066, 536873249, 536873362, 536873454, 536873590, 536873685, 536873973, 536874014, 536874706, 536874743, 536874813, 536874916, 536875046, 536875050, 536875055, 536875057, 536875081, 536875095, 536875098, 536875099, 536875131, 536875132, 536875158, 536875182, 536875199, 536875208, 536875217, 536875229, 536875271, 536875275, 536875286, 536875303, 536875310, 536875315, 536875322, 536875328, 536875330, 536875331, 536875332, 536875344, 536875356, 536875358, 536875362, 536875420, 536875421, 536875454, 536875483, 536875486, 536875488, 536875490, 536875501, 536875502, 536875504, 536875510, 536875511, 536875513, 536875523, 536875526, 536875527, 536875532, 536875534, 536875535, 536875536, 536875538, 536875542, 536875543, 536875545, 536875547, 536875548, 536875549, 536875559, 536875564, 536875565, 536875572, 536875638, 536875657, 536875665, 536875675, 536875695, 536875700, 536875705, 536875729, 536875741, 536875745, 536875752, 536875786, 536875804, 536875809, 536875819, 536875831, 536875832, 536875855, 536875910, 536875914, 536875937, 536876008, 536876009, 536876028, 536876029, 536876075, 536876083, 536876084, 536876095, 536876096, 536876097, 536876098, 536876108, 536876128, 536876130, 536876134, 536876167, 536876172, 536876184, 536876191, 536876198, 536876228, 536876270, 536876277, 536876287, 536876288, 536876304, 536876321, 536876325, 536876342, 536876355, 536876357, 536876429, 536876451, 536876456, 536876461, 536876464, 536876466, 536876469, 536876505, 536876511, 536876531, 536876553, 536876559, 536876567, 536876617, 536876665, 536876683, 536876687, 536876705, 536876706, 536876722, 536876769, 536876814, 536876833, 536876868, 536876875, 536876890, 536876924, 536877026, 536877109, 536877151, 536877183, 536877210, 536877253, 536877319, 536877352, 536877373, 536877375, 536877390, 536877424, 536877537, 536877587, 536877588, 536877742, 536877750, 536877905, 536877907, 536877954, 536877974, 536878028, 536878231, 536878260, 536878394, 536878515, 536878554, 536878584, 536878599, 536879011, 536879030, 536879065, 536879587, 536879713, 536879875, 536879957, 536880090, 536880137, 536880194, 536880195, 536880196, 536880197, 536880198, 536880199, 536880200, 536880201, 536880202, 536880203]",Any[12],Any[1],Any[7490],Any[15929],"Any[6, 9, 12, 14, 34, 39, 48, 49]","Any[533, 2031, 2939, 2993, 3188, 9498, 9727, 11270, 19531]",Tales from the Borderlands

A team of US scientists makes a frightening discovery on an island in the South China Sea. All contact with the team is lost when the North Korean Government quickly seals off the area. The United States responds by dispatching an elite team of Delta Force Operators to recon the situation. As tension rises between the two nations, a massive alien ship reveals itself in the middle of the island. The ship generates an immense force sphere that freezes a vast portion of the island and drastically alters the global weather system.

The Olympians immediately rush to battle; Helios rides on his chariot over Olympus, Hermes speeds down the very peaks of Olympus as Zeus watches on, Hercules receives the order to lead his troops down into the fray, Hades lunges off and engages several Titans in his giant form, and Poseidon (using his aquakinesis) shoots down from Olympus like a missile and performs a death blow through the chest of Epimetheus, and then manifests himself as a massive water being and spawns several water horses called Hippocampi to aid in the battle. With Poseidon as their greatest threat in the battle, having already decimated numerous Titans and soon going after Gaia herself, Kratos engages the God of the Sea and after drawing him into Gaia's grasp manages to knock a weakened Poseidon out of his godly form and onto a separate platform. The two quarrel with each other briefly before Kratos walks up and beats the Lord of the Sea savagely, finally gouging out his eyes and snapping his neck before he tosses him into the ocean. With Poseidon's death, the seas cataclysm and ocean levels rise significantly, causing a flood that appears to engulf the entire world and destroying almost all of mankind save those on top of Olympia.","Set in the realm of brutal Greek mythology, God of War III is a single-player game that allows players to take on the climatic role of the ex-Spartan warrior, Kratos, as he scales through the intimidating heights of Mt. Olympus and the dark depths of Hell to seek revenge on those who have betrayed him. Armed with double-chained blades, and an array of new weapons and magic for this iteration of the trilogy, Kratos must take on mythology's darkest creatures while solving intricate puzzles throughout his merciless quest to destroy Olympus.

The two track a cell to Cozumel in Mexico that is led by Pedro Dominguez, the head of Trinity's High Council. Slipping inside nearby tombs being excavated by Trinity, Lara discovers a temple containing the Dagger of Chak Chel and references to a hidden city. Murals adorning the walls allude to the Silver Box of Ix Chel and warn of ""the Cleansing"", a Mayan apocalypse culminating in a permanent solar eclipse. Lara ignores the warnings and takes the Dagger to prevent Trinity from acquiring it. Dominguez catches her and reveals that by taking the Dagger, Lara has triggered the Cleansing. He takes the Dagger, intending to unite it with the Box to stop the Cleansing and use the power it grants him to remake the world in his image. Lara and Jonah escape a tsunami that destroys Cozumel and foreshadows the coming apocalypse. 
Despite growing tensions between them over her actions, Lara and Jonah pursue Dominguez into the Amazon. Their plane crashes in the Peruvian jungle during the second cataclysm—a massive storm—and the two find their way to Paititi, the hidden city shown in the murals. Exploring local tombs reveals that piercing the Box with the Dagger will grant the user the power of the god Kukulkan, which must be used to halt the Cleansing. Lara witnesses Trinity soldiers being slaughtered by strange humanoid monsters later identified as the Yaaxil, guardians of the Box. When Lara saves a boy named Etzli, she and Jonah are brought into Paititi by his mother Unuratu, queen of the city. Lara sees Dominguez is the leader of a cult dedicated to Kukulkan and Unuratu reveals he is her brother-in-law Amaru, who was taken by Trinity as a child and raised to complete the ritual and reshape the world in their image. Unuratu directs Lara to the Box, but Lara finds it is missing. Believing the cult already has the Box, Lara, and Unuratu attempt to steal it, but Unuratu is captured. Lara also encounters the Yaaxil and their leader Crimson Fire. 
Lara infiltrates the cult's temple and overhears Amaru telling Unuratu that the Box was hidden by Andres Lopez, a missionary sent to Paititi by Trinity during the Spanish conquest of South America. Lara rescues Unuratu and realizes that Amaru does not fully understand the ritual; rather than merely imbuing Kukulkan's power, the ritual sacrifices it to stop the Cleansing. Unuratu is shot by Commander Rourke, Amaru's second in command. Before she dies, Unuratu implores Lara to complete the ritual but warns her not to let the Box influence her. Rourke attacks Lara and Jonah, who are separated as they leave Paititi to decipher the next clue. Thinking Jonah dead, Lara goes on a rampage that destroys an oil refinery and slaughters everyone there except Rourke, who escapes. She momentarily breaks down when she finds Jonah alive, but he manages to calm her, and they decipher the Box's location. Driven mad by the Box, Lopez established a mission near Paititi where he trained acolytes to complete the ritual. Lara and Jonah find a secret catacomb beneath the missiong leading to Lopez's tomb and the Box. Amaru finds them and forces Lara to surrender the Box. He admits that he ordered her father's death to prevent him from finding Paititi and revealing it to the world. Lara tries to persuade Amaru to use the ritual to benefit the world. He refuses, as the Cleansing will only affect Paititi. Amaru has used his position in Trinity to manipulate them into preventing it. He leaves Lara and Jonah to escape the third cataclysm, a massive earthquake that causes a landslide and destroys the mission. 
Back in Paititi, Lara and Jonah help the newly-crowned Etzli lead an assault on an underground temple complex at Paititi's center. They plan to disrupt Amaru's ceremony while avoiding the fourth cataclysm, a volcanic eruption threatening Paititi. Lara is forced to go on alone when Trinity cuts off Etzli's forces. She encounters the Yaaxil and Crimson Fire, convincing them to help her stop Amaru. Lara takes on the symbolic role of Ix Chel while Crimson Fire becomes Chak Chel. While the Yaaxil kill Rourke and the Trinity High Council, Lara makes it to the temple summit. She fails to stop Amaru from piercing the Box and absorbing Kukulkan's power as an eclipse blocks the sun. Lara overpowers Amaru after a lengthy battle; accepting defeat, he transfers Kukulkan's power to Lara as he dies. True to Unuratu's warning, she is tempted to use the Box to revive her parents, but instead lets Crimson Fire symbolically stab her, sacrificing Kukulkan's spirit and stopping the Cleansing. In the aftermath, Unuratu is laid to rest, and Jonah decides to take a vacation. Lara stays in Paititi to help Etzli restore the city to its former glory. A post-credits scene shows Lara planning her next adventure at Croft Manor, acknowledging that her role is not to solve the world's mysteries, but to protect them.","Experience Lara Croft's defining moment.

Dr. Edward Richtofen is heard via a television, carrying out his scheme on the Moon. Richtofen seizes control of the zombies by entering the Aether, but Dr. Ludvig Maxis works with his daughter Samantha and Richtofen's former allies, Tank Dempsey, Nikolai Belinski, and Takeo Masakai to thwart him. To this end, Maxis launches three massive nuclear missiles filled with Element 115, the element responsible for the reanimation of dead cells, at the Earth, destroying it. One missile completely destroys Nuketown and all present.  
Years later, Earth has been reduced to a crumbling, hellish wasteland overrun by zombies. In this new world, four survivors - Samuel J. Stuhlinger, Abigail ""Misty"" Briarton, Marlton Johnson, and Russman - have banded together to survive in Washington with the help of a bus driven by a robotic driver. The four are contacted by Maxis, now an digitally-rendered A.I., who is seeking humanity's aid against Richtofen. Maxis implores them to power up a tower in a cornfield using an electricity-based zombie. However, Richtofen contacts Samuel, who is able to hear voices from the Aether, and commands him to convince his friends to power up the tower in his favor. The player may choose to follow either Maxis or Richtofen's orders. It is revealed in audio transmissions that survivors from all over the world have been contacted by both Maxis and Richtofen, though there is widespread conflict between the followers of both Germans; particularly in a settlement known as Jackass Flats, which was initially a safe haven, only to fall to the zombies when the Maxis-Richtofen conflict consumed it.  
Regardless of who they choose to aid, the four are teleported to a crumbling skyline in Shanghai, China. Here, Richtofen commands Samuel to ""mend the rift"" and accept his fate as a follower of Richtofen, threatening to expose his past as a member of a cannibalistic cult known as The Flesh, who eat zombie flesh to survive. Richtofen continuously revives the group whenever they fall to the zombies until they follow his orders. Maxis, who is no longer hampered by electric devices, contacts the group again for aid. The four learn through televisions scattered across the area of the Flesh, as well as the beginnings of a new airborne plague of Element 115, the element that reanimates dead cells and causes zombies.  
Following their battles in Shanghai, Russman leads the group across the continents to a large hole in the ground known as ""the Rift"" in Africa, hoping to find answers about the unseen forces commanding them. Maxis and Richtofen contact them once again, more desperate than ever to achieve their goals. Both of them ask the group to power up the third and final tower in their favor. Maxis promises to heal the Earth, and Richtofen promises to save them from Maxis. The four gain a new ally in the form of a mute, unnamed giant in a western town built underground, and are hampered by a ghostly woman in a massive mansion. Depending on who the player has aided in the story, there are two possible endings. If the player has aided Richtofen, he will gain unlimited power over the Aether and the Earth, kill Maxis and condemn Samantha Maxis' soul to eternal damnation. He will then enter the body of Samuel as a reward for his aid, but finds he cannot exit it, and is at the mercy of the zombies as he was before. If the player has aided Maxis, he uses the power from the towers to enter the Aether and assume ultimate control, trapping Richtofen in a zombie's body. However, the Earth begins shaking, and Maxis explains to the four that he is beginning the process of the destruction of the Earth and humanity to reach Agartha, where he believes Samantha is.  
Unbeknownst to all, Samantha is indeed in Agartha (which her father ultimately fails to enter) but reaches out to her father in 1918 France during World War I. Maxis is a leader of Group 935, who operate to secure Germany's victory in the war. To this end, they have created towering mechanical robots, suits of armor, and staffs that control the powers of the elements. Group 935 also stumbles upon an ancient tomb believed to be of Vrill origin, but this unleashes the first known zombie outbreak in history. Aiming to stop Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States of America send Takeo, Nikolai and Dempsey to capture Richtofen, the mastermind behind the advanced technology. By this time, Group 935's operatives have been wiped out, and Maxis himself was lobotomized when he began to turn into a zombie. The group put aside their nationalities to fight the undead, and are contacted by Samantha, begging to be freed from Agartha. Richtofen puts Maxis' brain in a flying drone, and he joins the fight against the zombies and to free Samantha. The group is eventually successful, and while Maxis meets his daughter, they enter Agartha to be rewarded. A cutscene is played of Samantha with a boy named Eddie, playing with toys of the characters who have appeared in the Zombies game mode throughout all three games. Air raid sirens are heard and the two children retreat to the basement with Maxis, with Samantha noting her father has a plan to make their games real. It is ambiguous as to whether the events of the game mode have actually occurred or has all along been simply in Samantha's imagination.",Black Ops II is the first game in the Call of Duty franchise to feature future warfare technology and the first to present branching storylines driven by player choice as well as selecting weapons before starting story mode missions.,"Any[1, 18, 39, 268435461, 536870913, 536870914, 536870917, 536870920, 536870937, 536870982, 536871041, 536871365, 536871436, 536871452, 536871474, 536871475, 536871486, 536871506, 536871535, 536871572, 536871882, 536872032, 536872205, 536872225, 536872245, 536872315, 536872375, 536872383, 536872406, 536872695, 536872733, 536872847, 536873053, 536873455, 536873658, 536873753, 536874345, 536874449, 536874743, 536874900, 536874916, 536875046, 536875062, 536875073, 536875081, 536875090, 536875098, 536875122, 536875154, 536875157, 536875171, 536875194, 536875196, 536875199, 536875242, 536875265, 536875271, 536875358, 536875396, 536875420, 536875422, 536875435, 536875440, 536875456, 536875491, 536875492, 536875523, 536875573, 536875593, 536875623, 536875625, 536875629, 536875642, 536875652, 536875743, 536875767, 536875781, 536875802, 536875804, 536875807, 536875808, 536875809, 536875812, 536875813, 536875818, 536875819, 536875821, 536875830, 536875839, 536875842, 536875843, 536875844, 536875845, 536875941, 536876054, 536876073, 536876090, 536876106, 536876197, 536876212, 536876219, 536876221, 536876223, 536876235, 536876331, 536876391, 536876393, 536876441, 536876466, 536876472, 536876496, 536876521, 536876545, 536876568, 536876577, 536876603, 536876625, 536876695, 536876701, 536876702, 536876703, 536876706, 536876759, 536876762, 536876797, 536876811, 536876812, 536876821, 536876853, 536876871, 536876899, 536876948, 536876961, 536876987, 536877047, 536877049, 536877057, 536877109, 536877113, 536877151, 536877178, 536877217, 536877222, 536877246, 536877312, 536877338, 536877363, 536877414, 536877493, 536877500, 536877588, 536877605, 536877741, 536877806, 536877985, 536878003, 536878016, 536878018, 536878025, 536878206, 536878268, 536878298, 536878322, 536878415, 536878427, 536878533, 536878549, 536879042, 536879052, 536879056, 536879811, 536879832, 536879838, 536879934, 536879983, 536880277, 536880360, 536880547, 536880615, 536880721, 536880783, 536880786, 536880789, 536880901, 536881234, 536881284, 536881410, 536881463, 536881504, 536881687, 536881831, 536881999, 536882009, 536882308, 536882326, 536882327, 536882328, 536882329, 536882330, 536882331, 536882332, 536882333, 536882334, 536882335, 536882336, 536882337, 536882338, 536882339, 536882340, 536882341, 536882342, 536882343, 536882344, 536887628, 536889479, 536890607, 536891754, 536891755]",Any[123],"Any[1, 2, 3, 4]",Null,"Any[19979, 19980, 19981]","Any[6, 9, 12, 41]","Any[545, 564, 960, 979, 1006, 2031, 2033, 5647, 6632]",Call of Duty: Black Ops II

But when they attempt to rob a bank with actor Josh Birk, who is to play a Saint's member, their everyday routine takes an unlikely turn when the bank tellers unexpectedly start an all out gun war on the saints. The Saints attempt to airlift the vault out of the building, but when Birk foolishly sets off the alarm, it alerts the Stilwater P.D. and, after a large-scale firefight with police and S.W.A.T, the Saints are incarcerated. 
In jail, Saints second-in-command Johnny Gat laments what the Saints have become, expressing disappointment at having strayed from their roots. At that point, an international criminal organization, called The Syndicate, bribes the police to release the Boss, Gat, and Shaundi. The three are forcibly taken to the Syndicate's leader Phillipe Loren, to try and negotiate a business plan with them aboard Loren's private jet. While in-flight, Loren tells them they will be allowed to live if they turn over 2/3 of the Saints' business in Stilwater. The Boss and Gat immediately reject this offer, and are able to fight their way out, with Gat commanding the plane back to Stilwater. The Boss and Shaundi use a parachute to escape the plane, but Gat is believed to be killed in the process. 
Upon landing, the Boss and Shaundi find themselves in Steelport, the dystopian criminal city controlled by the Syndicate, a group of three gangs: The Morning Star, a gang with advanced technology equipment, controlled by Loren himself, the Luchadores, a Mexican gang lead by the killer wrestler Killbane, and the Deckers, a hacker-based gang led by Matt Miller. After calling Pierce Washington, the Boss's second-in-command, to Steelport, the Saints seize a Morning Star penthouse for their new headquarters, hijack a UAV from a military base, and begin attacking Morning Star's businesses, culminating with an attack on Syndicate Tower, Loren's headquarters, in which the Saints rescue Oleg Kirlov, an apparent superhuman and template for the Syndicate's Brute clones, and Loren is killed. When the Saints try to transport Gat's body to Stilwater for his funeral, Killbane, now leader of the Syndicate, leads an attack on them. The fight destroys Stilwater's Hughes Memorial Bridge in the process. 
To retaliate, the player seeks out anti-Syndicate talent, recruiting Oleg as an enforcer, ex-FBI hacker Kinzie Kensington as an informant; Zimos, the oldest pimp in Steelport; and Angel de la Muerte, Killbane's vengeful former tag-team partner. They are later joined by Viola DeWynter after Killbane kills her twin sister Kiki out of rage due to a failed assassination attempt on the Boss. Her defection, however, coincides with the arrival of the paramilitary S.T.A.G. (Special Tactical Anti-Gang) forces in Steelport, created by Senator Monica Hughes after the destruction of the bridge to end gang violence once and for all. The Saints take on STAG regardless, resulting in Steelport going under martial law, whilst also dealing with the Syndicate. 
After providing Kinzie with the appropriate technology, the player enters the Deckers mainframe, defeating Deckers leader Matt Miller's avatar in a virtual reality fight and driving him and most of the Deckers out of town. At Angel's insistence, the player opts to take on Killbane by killing the other contestants in his Murderbrawl XXXI pay-per-view to gain entrance, and then, with Angel's help, defeating Killbane in Murderbrawl with the option to unmask or spare him. Following his humiliating defeat, an enraged Killbane responds by instigating several attacks on the Saints and STAG throughout Steelport to cause chaos. 
Whilst quelling the fighting between the Luchadores and STAG, the Boss is simultaneously informed that Killbane is escaping the city while STAG second-in-command Kia is holding Shaundi, Viola, and Mayor Burt Reynolds hostage at a Steelport monument rigged to blow to frame the Saints. The Boss kills Kia and saves Shaundi and the others, the Saints are hailed as heroes for saving the monument and STAG pulls out of Steelport with the threat that they will be back. The Boss tracks Killbane down to Mars and kill him in what is ultimately revealed to be a scene from the Saints sci-fi film Gangstas in Space, which the Boss and several members are acting in. 
An alternate, non-canonical ending plays out should the player opt to eliminate Killbane. In which the destruction of the monument is used as a pretext by STAG to attack Steelport with the airborne aircraft carrier Daedalus. The Boss destroys the Daedalus, killing STAG leader Cyrus Temple in the process, and declares Steelport an independent city-state under the Saints' control, with Pierce taking charge as mayor, and the Boss as the ultimate leader.","Saints Row: The Third is the first Saints Row game that takes place in the city of Steelport. Much like the first two games, the story revolves around the Saints destroying and absorbing three rival gangs, taking over the city in the process. In Saints Row: The Third, these three gangs are the Morningstar, the Luchadores, and the Deckers. Unlike the first two games, these three gangs are all controlled by a criminal organization known as The Syndicate, which the saints must also deal with.","Any[1, 27, 33, 38, 268435461, 268435466, 268435487, 536870917, 536870933, 536870937, 536870959, 536871033, 536871041, 536871067, 536871094, 536871133, 536871134, 536871186, 536871196, 536871213, 536871221, 536871226, 536871262, 536871313, 536871396, 536871452, 536871525, 536871615, 536871618, 536871801, 536871889, 536871937, 536872070, 536872100, 536872205, 536872225, 536872315, 536872352, 536872371, 536872581, 536872587, 536872590, 536872626, 536872862, 536872883, 536872914, 536873010, 536873449, 536873455, 536873810, 536873868, 536874450, 536874552, 536874743, 536874916, 536875047, 536875057, 536875062, 536875069, 536875073, 536875089, 536875091, 536875111, 536875157, 536875162, 536875183, 536875184, 536875185, 536875199, 536875257, 536875271, 536875281, 536875300, 536875310, 536875315, 536875322, 536875356, 536875364, 536875396, 536875432, 536875437, 536875453, 536875490, 536875494, 536875521, 536875523, 536875525, 536875527, 536875556, 536875559, 536875593, 536875597, 536875610, 536875623, 536875638, 536875642, 536875682, 536875688, 536875689, 536875693, 536875735, 536875764, 536875766, 536875781, 536875782, 536875802, 536875803, 536875804, 536875819, 536875822, 536875830, 536875868, 536875895, 536875896, 536875904, 536875932, 536875937, 536876062, 536876063, 536876070, 536876071, 536876125, 536876126, 536876190, 536876220, 536876221, 536876261, 536876289, 536876298, 536876330, 536876356, 536876369, 536876383, 536876384, 536876386, 536876429, 536876476, 536876505, 536876509, 536876521, 536876537, 536876545, 536876552, 536876569, 536876575, 536876606, 536876643, 536876695, 536876703, 536876708, 536876726, 536876762, 536876812, 536876817, 536876821, 536876823, 536876851, 536876853, 536876855, 536876901, 536876934, 536876954, 536876968, 536876978, 536876987, 536876991, 536877000, 536877032, 536877035, 536877109, 536877144, 536877158, 536877161, 536877207, 536877234, 536877275, 536877285, 536877286, 536877295, 536877398, 536877405, 536877409, 536877439, 536877628, 536877642, 536877650, 536877664, 536877744, 536877968, 536877986, 536877998, 536878001, 536878009, 536878026, 536878036, 536878227, 536878233, 536878247, 536878270, 536878363, 536878394, 536879022, 536879023, 536879062, 536879084, 536879184, 536879188, 536879602, 536879711, 536879715, 536879740, 536879755, 536879788, 536879824, 536879873, 536879910, 536879957, 536879973, 536879978, 536879979, 536880190, 536880223, 536880481, 536880661, 536880697, 536880704, 536880711, 536880863, 536880864, 536880866, 536881068, 536881080, 536881103, 536881163, 536881243, 536881507, 536881595, 536881608, 536881635, 536881653, 536882120, 536882154, 536882160, 536882386, 536882508, 536882509, 536882514, 536882782, 536882797, 536882806, 536882820, 536882954, 536883229, 536883374, 536884362, 536884363, 536884364, 536884365, 536884366, 536889479, 536892343, 536892344]",Any[8],"Any[1, 2, 3]",Any[609],"Any[1909, 2259, 2260, 19007, 19008]","Any[6, 9, 12, 130]","Any[40, 127, 564, 732, 960, 1020, 1121, 1981, 19441]",Saints Row: The Third

She informs Geralt that Emperor Emhyr has summoned him to the city of Vizima. There, Emhyr tasks Geralt with finding Ciri, who has been recently spotted in various locations. Ciri is a Child of the Elder Blood, the last heir to an ancient Elven bloodline that bestows her with the power to manipulate space and time. 
 
Geralt first follows clues that Ciri was in Velen at Crow's Perch, the fort of the Bloody Baron. The Baron refuses to help, but Geralt's acquaintance, sorceress Keira Metz, informs him that an Elven mage, Avallac'h, was searching for Ciri. Keira directs Geralt to the Crones of Crookback Bog, malicious, ancient spirits residing near Velen. The Crones reveal that they had captured Ciri for the Wild Hunt before she escaped, and that they have enslaved the Baron's missing wife, Anna. After determining Anna's fate, Geralt returns to the Baron who tells him that Ciri went to Novigrad. 
 
Arriving in Novigrad, Geralt discovers that the Church of the Eternal Fire, a militant religious organization, is purging mages in the city. Rendezvousing with his former lover, Triss Merigold, Geralt learns that Ciri had contacted his friend Dandelion. Geralt navigates Novigrad's criminal underworld to rescue Dandelion, and discovers that Ciri teleported to the Skellige archipelago. While in Novigrad, Geralt may assist Triss in liberating fugitive mages. 
 
After sailing to Skellige, Geralt reunites with Yennefer, who has been investigating a magical explosion linked to Ciri. The pair track Ciri's movements to the island of Lofoten and learn the Wild Hunt have attacked it. Following clues, they realise that Uma, a deformed, cursed creature at Crow's Perch, was present following Ciri's escape. Before leaving Skellige, Geralt can help determine who will become the leader of Skellige following the king's death. Yennefer chooses to sever the magical bond that draws her and Geralt together, giving him the option to willingly affirm his love for her or end their relationship. 
 
The pair recover Uma to the abandoned witcher school of Kaer Morhen where Yennefer successfully removes Uma's curse, transforming him into Avallac'h. He reveals that he teleported Ciri to the Isle of Mists to save her from the Lofoten attack. Geralt travels to the Isle and finds Ciri in a deathlike state until she is awakened by Avallac'h's magic. Ciri reveals that the King of the Wild Hunt, Eredin's homeworld is being destroyed by a plight known as the White Frost, and he wants Ciri's power in order to conquer the Continent. Ciri and Geralt teleport to Kaer Morhen pursued by the Wild Hunt. After a brief reunion with Yennefer, Triss, and their witcher mentor Vesemir, the Hunt attacks. Vesemir is killed protecting Ciri and her distress causes her to uncontrollably unleash her Elder power leading Eredin and the Hunt to retreat. Geralt, Yennefer, Triss, Ciri, and their allies then hold a funeral for Vesemir. 
 
Ciri and Geralt travel to Novigrad and help Triss and Yennefer reform the Lodge of Sorceresses to aid in their fight. They also learn about the Sunstone, a relic that can lure Eredin out and bind him to a location. On the Skelligan isle of Undvik, Avallac'h uses the Sunstone to draw out the Hunt and their fleet. Geralt, Ciri, their allies and the Nilfgaardian fleet battle the Hunt, before Geralt faces Eredin in combat and emerges victorious. As the White Frost descends on Skellige, Ciri insists that she must confront it with her Elder Blood before it consumes all life on every world. Ciri enters a portal and defeats the White Frost, ending the threat. 
 
The ending varies depending on choices made throughout the game. If Ciri is alive, Geralt can retire with either Yennefer or Triss, or remain a lone Witcher. If Geralt helps Nilfgaard win the war and took Ciri to meet the emperor, she will become Empress, believing it the best way to positively affect the world; if Ciri doesn't meet the Emperor, Geralt fakes her death and she becomes a Witcher. If Ciri dies fighting the White Frost, Geralt hunts down her stolen medallion as a keepsake, but is surrounded by monsters upon its discovery, leaving his fate ambiguous.

As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you. 
 
HITMAN is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st. 
 
HITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode. 
 
An Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return. 
 
Escalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic. 
 
Contracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.","Any[1, 23, 38, 268435461, 268435480, 268435487, 536870932, 536870934, 536871044, 536871529, 536871797, 536871813, 536871945, 536872131, 536872581, 536873318, 536873454, 536873591, 536874014, 536874136, 536874688, 536874804, 536874834, 536875081, 536875091, 536875130, 536875131, 536875132, 536875188, 536875269, 536875328, 536875358, 536875415, 536875420, 536875436, 536875437, 536875551, 536875570, 536875626, 536875677, 536875731, 536875741, 536875744, 536875783, 536875794, 536875795, 536875801, 536875819, 536875830, 536875892, 536875919, 536876114, 536876178, 536876302, 536876322, 536876577, 536876665, 536876826, 536876838, 536876911, 536877157, 536877170, 536877306, 536877327, 536877339, 536877346, 536877349, 536877630, 536877753, 536877805, 536877854, 536877911, 536878584, 536879879, 536879934, 536879950, 536880860, 536881327, 536881429, 536881688, 536881689, 536881690, 536881691, 536881692, 536881693, 536881694, 536881695, 536881696, 536881697, 536881698, 536884963, 536884964, 536884981, 536887738, 536887740, 536889862, 536889863]",Any[528],Any[1],Null,"Any[37290, 54387, 54388, 54389, 54390, 58600]","Any[3, 6, 14, 48, 49, 203]","Any[530, 7323, 7331, 10239, 11156, 11171, 11492, 19564, 25076]",HITMAN

During the campaigns, the story is told from alternating points of view, giving players the opportunity to play as each of the town alignments.

Following the disappearance of King Roland Ironfist of Enroth prior to Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven, his wife, Queen Catherine, is left to rule the realm. In the meantime, her father, King Gryphonheart of Erathia, is assassinated. Without their beloved King, the kingdom of Erathia falls to the dark forces of Nighon and Eeofol. Queen Catherine returns home to Antagarich seeking to rally the people of her homeland and lead them against the evil that has ravaged their nation.

Erathia's capital of Steadwick is sacked by the dungeon lords of Nighon and the Kreegans of Eeofol. Meanwhile, the nations of Tatalia and Krewlod skirmish at the western border, seizing the chance to expand their territory. Catherine's first task is to establish a foothold in the conquered kingdom by enlisting the aid of allies. The wizards of Bracada and the elves of AvLee answer her call, and together they push towards Steadwick and eventually retake it, quickly quelling the border war in the west. Soon after, Lucifer Kreegan, a commander in the Eeofol armies, sends an envoy to Erathia claiming that Roland Ironfist is captive within their territories. AvLee invades Eeofol, but fails to rescue Roland, who is transported to their northern holdings. Afterwards, Catherine invades Nighon, pushing the dungeon armies back to their island home.

In the meantime, the necromancers of Deyja, having been responsible for the assassination of King Gryphonheart, plot to revive his corpse as a lich. They plan to use his wisdom in leading their own armies of the undead. However, King Gryphonheart's will proves too much for the necromancers even in his corrupted state, and he becomes a rogue lich. Having little other recourse, Queen Catherine is forced to ally herself with the necromancers and together they set out to destroy the lich of King Gryphonheart before he becomes too powerful.

A final bonus campaign, accessible only after the main campaigns are complete, tells the story of separatists living in the Contested Lands, a war-torn border between Erathia and AvLee. Tired of the skirmishes that bring unrest to their homelands, they join together to fight for independence from the two large kingdoms. It is later implied that this rising was orchestrated by Archibald Ironfist, the antagonist of Heroes of Might and Magic II.","Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Restoration of Erathia is a turn-based strategy game developed by Jon Van Caneghem through New World Computing originally released for Microsoft Windows by the 3DO Company in 1999. Its ports to several computer and console systems followed in 1999-2000. It is the third installment of the Heroes of Might and Magic series. The player can choose to play through seven different campaigns telling the story, or play in a scenario against computer or human opponents.
The gameplay is very similar to its predecessors in that the player controls a number of heroes that command an army of creatures inspired by myth and legend. The gameplay is divided into two parts, tactical overland exploration and a turn based combat system. The player creates an army by spending resources at one of the eight town types in the game.

Manuel ""Manny"" Calavera is a travel agent at the Department of Death in the city of El Marrow, forced into his job to work off a debt ""to the powers that be"". Manny is frustrated with being assigned clients that must take the four-year journey and is threatened to be fired by his boss, Don Copal, if he does not come up with better clients. Manny steals a client, Mercedes ""Meche"" Colomar, from his co-worker Domino Hurley. The Department computers assign Meche to the four-year journey even though Manny believes she should have a guaranteed spot on the ""Number Nine"" luxury express train due to her pureness of heart in her life. After setting Meche on her way, Manny investigates further and finds that Domino and Don have been rigging the system to deny many clients Double N tickets, hoarding them for the boss of the criminal underworld, Hector LeMans. LeMans then sells the tickets at an exorbitant price to those that can afford it. Manny recognizes that he cannot stop Hector at present and instead, with the help of his driver and speed demon Glottis, he tries to find Meche on her journey in the nearby Petrified Forest. During the trip Manny encounters Salvador ""Sal"" Limones, the leader of the small underground organization Lost Souls Alliance (LSA), who is aware of Hector's plans and recruits Manny to help. Manny arrives at the small port city of Rubacava and finds that he has beaten Meche there, and waits for her to show up.

A year passes, and the city of Rubacava has grown. Manny now runs his own nightclub off a converted automat near the edge of the Forest. Manny learns from Olivia Ofrenda that Don has been ""sprouted"" for letting the scandal be known and that Meche was recently seen with Domino leaving the port. Manny gives chase and a year later tracks them to a coral mining plant on the Edge of the World. Domino has been holding Meche there as a trap to lure Manny. All of Domino's clients who had their tickets stolen are also being held there and used as slave labor, both to make a profit with the coral mining and as a way to keep Hector's scandal quiet. Domino tries to convince Manny to take over his position in the plant seeing as he has no alternative and can spend the rest of eternity with Meche but he refuses. After rescuing Meche, Manny defeats Domino by causing him to fall into a rock crusher. Manny, along with Meche, Glottis and all the souls being held at the plant then escape from the Edge of the World.

The three travel for another year until they reach the terminus for the Number Nine train before the Ninth Underworld. Unfortunately, the Gate Keeper to the Ninth Underworld won't let the souls progress without their tickets, mistakenly believing they have sold them. Meanwhile, Glottis has fallen deathly ill. Manny learns from demons stationed at the terminus that the only way to revive Glottis is to travel at high speeds to restore Glottis' purpose for being summoned. Manny and the others devise a makeshift fuel source to create a ""rocket"" train cart, quickly taking Manny and Meche back to Rubacava and saving Glottis' life. The three return to El Marrow, now found to be fully in Hector's control and renamed as Nuevo Marrow. Manny regroups with Sal and his expanded LSA and with the help of Olivia, who volunteered to join the gang earlier in Rubacava, and is able to learn about Hector's current activities. Further investigation reveals that Hector not only has been hoarding the Number Nine tickets, but has created counterfeit versions that he has sold to others. Manny tries to confront Hector but is lured into another trap by Olivia, who has also captured Sal, and is taken to Hector's greenhouse to be sprouted. Manny is able to defeat Hector after Sal sacrifices himself to prevent Olivia from interfering. Manny and Meche are able to find the real Double N tickets, including the one that Meche should have received. Manny makes sure the rest of the tickets are given to their rightful owners; in turn, he is granted his own for his good deeds. Together, Manny and Meche board the Number Nine for their happy journey to the Ninth Underworld.","A neo-noir adventure to the Land of the Dead.

His intentions and connection to the heroes unknown, Irenicus conducts experiments on them, holding them in cages somewhere in his vast underground complex. During his absence, the heroes manage to escape, and soon find themselves in the city of Athkatla in the country of Amn, where they confront Irenicus. However, at that moment several wizards arrive and arrest both Irenicus and Imoen for unlicensed use of magic. The first task at hand is to raise the money needed to rescue Imoen, before facing Irenicus again and unraveling his true goals. 
 
Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn is a party-based role-playing game using the AD&D rules. The basic gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor: the player navigates a party of up to six active combatants over isometric environments, conversing with non-playable characters using branching dialogue, and fighting enemies in real-time, free-movement combat that can be paused to issue specific orders to the characters. World traveling now occurs by selecting locations on a map rather than exploring wilderness areas to reach the destination. However, the game world is larger than in the previous game, with more individual locations to visit and side quests to perform. 
 
Being a direct sequel to Baldur's Gate, the game lets the player control stronger, higher-level characters from the onset. The main character can also be imported from the previous installment. Three new classes (sorcerer, monk, and barbarian) are available along with those that were present in the original game. Characters can also acquire specializations within most of the classes: a paladin, for instance, can become a dragon slayer or an inquisitor. Weapon proficiencies are more specific: for example, instead of just specializing in blades, the player can choose between proficiencies in long swords, two-handed swords, bastard swords, katanas and scimitars. There are many new types of weapons, armor, and magic spells in the sequel. 
 
Sixteen characters may join the party during the course of the story. Each of them has his or her own motivations, sometimes conflicting with those of other characters. Scripted events and interaction with playable as well as non-playable characters have been noticeably increased in the sequel. The main character can also romance some of the companions by choosing appropriate behavior and dialogue lines. The game allows the player to make many moral decisions and pursue character-specific side quests unrelated to the main story. Many of the companions bring their own quests, and unique tasks are available for the main character depending on his or her class.","Every World has conflict. Good and evil. Friend and foe. Safety and danger. In Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn, you'll find yourself between these factions.

Set in the immediate aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, L4D's survival co-op mode lets you blast a path through the infected in four unique “movies,” guiding your survivors across the rooftops of an abandoned metropolis, through rural ghost towns and pitch-black forests in your quest to escape a devastated Ground Zero crawling with infected enemies.

As he suddenly loses contact with the ICA, Agent 47 senses that he may be the next target, so our merciless contract killer travels to America to take care of business himself…","Hitman Blood Money is the fourth installment of the critically acclaimed Hitman series. If Agent 47 must stay hidden, make clean ‘hits’ and leave the scene unnoticed, he will be rewarded. But if he is revealed during a violent act, his picture will end up in the papers and on wanted posters, making the job as a contract killer more difficult.

The Prince seeks counsel from an old wise man who explains that whoever releases The Sands of Time must die. Because the Prince escaped his fate, it is the Dahaka's mission as guardian of the Timeline to ensure that he dies as he was meant to. The old man also tells of the Island of Time, where the Empress of Time first created the Sands. The Prince sets sail for the Island in an attempt to prevent the Sands from ever being created, an act he believes will appease the Dahaka. After a battle at sea with an enemy force led by a mysterious woman in black capsizes the Prince's ship, the Prince washes ashore unconsciously onto the Island of Time.    
He later awakens and chases the woman in black through the Empress of Time's fortress into a portal that transports the two into the past. The Prince saves a woman named Kaileena from being killed by the woman in black, whose name is Shahdee. Unable to grant the Prince an audience with the Empress of Time, who is busy preparing to create the Sands, Kaileena instead tells him how to unlock the door to the throne room in which the Empress resides. The Prince makes his way through the fortress, utilizing the sand portals to travel back and forth between the past and present, and narrowly escapes several encounters with the Dahaka, who he discovers cannot pass through water. The Prince activates the mechanisms in the two towers of the fortress - the Garden Tower and the Mechanical Tower - that serve as locks to the door. He returns to the throne room only to discover that Kaileena is actually the Empress of Time herself, who has foreseen in the Timeline that the Prince will kill her and who has decided to attempt to defy her fate, just as the Prince is doing. A battle ensues and the Prince proves victorious; he kills Kaileena and returns to the present. What lies ahead is the most dramatic Twist in the Prince's life, and He starts believing the priest who told him ""You cant change your Fate! No Man Can..""  But Prince is not going to give up that easily.","Prince of Persia: Warrior Within is a video game and sequel to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Warrior Within was developed and published by Ubisoft, and released on December 2, 2004 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Microsoft Windows. It picks up where The Sands of Time left off, adding new features, specifically, options in combat. The Prince now has the ability to wield two weapons at a time as well as the ability to steal his enemies' weapons and throw them. The Prince's repertoire of combat moves has been expanded into varying strings that allow players to attack enemies with more complexity than was possible in the previous game. Warrior Within has a darker tone than its predecessor adding in the ability for the Prince to dispatch his enemies with various finishing moves. In addition to the rewind, slow-down, and speed-up powers from The Sands of Time, the Prince also has a new sand power: a circular ""wave"" of sand that knocks down all surrounding enemies as well as damaging them. The dark tone, a vastly increased level of blood and violence as well as sexualized female NPCs earned the game an M ESRB rating.","Any[1, 268435460, 268435464, 268435487, 536871049, 536871082, 536871088, 536871139, 536871208, 536871213, 536871301, 536871302, 536871470, 536871738, 536871758, 536871865, 536871945, 536872010, 536872070, 536872201, 536872205, 536872221, 536872225, 536872257, 536872352, 536872983, 536873053, 536873067, 536873384, 536873674, 536874190, 536874209, 536874398, 536875047, 536875050, 536875073, 536875081, 536875091, 536875092, 536875099, 536875101, 536875157, 536875199, 536875257, 536875271, 536875281, 536875301, 536875364, 536875437, 536875453, 536875492, 536875606, 536875621, 536875768, 536875778, 536875805, 536875830, 536875934, 536876006, 536876087, 536876199, 536876266, 536876351, 536876355, 536876359, 536876432, 536876476, 536876695, 536876735, 536876755, 536876995, 536876996, 536877047, 536877056, 536877294, 536877377, 536877628, 536877658, 536877659, 536878256, 536878264, 536878505, 536878523, 536878600, 536879092, 536879123, 536879223, 536879895, 536879992, 536880251, 536880274, 536880294, 536880318, 536880327, 536880441, 536881414, 536881716, 536882765, 536882820, 536883035, 536883319, 536883320, 536883321, 536883322, 536883870, 536883899, 536884022, 536884494, 536884840, 536886310]",Any[76],Any[1],Null,"Any[8153, 8154, 58527]","Any[6, 8, 9, 11, 21, 38, 39]","Any[127, 551, 836, 2437, 2468, 3025, 5181, 7346, 22565]",Prince of Persia: Warrior Within

Immediately following the events in Doom, the player once again assumes the role of the unnamed space marine. After defeating the demon invasion of the Mars moon bases and returning from Hell (the manifestation of Hell where the Deimos moon floats over), Doomguy finds that Earth has also been invaded by the demons, who have killed billions of people.[10][11] 
 
The humans who survived the attack have developed a plan to build massive spaceships which will carry the remaining survivors into space. Once the ships are ready, the survivors prepare to evacuate Earth. Unfortunately, Earth's only ground spaceport gets taken over by the demons, who place a flame barrier over it, preventing any ships from leaving.[10] The marine then battles hordes of demons and is able to deactivate the force field, allowing the remaining humans to escape. Once all the survivors escape Earth, the marine is the only human left on the planet.[12] 
 
Just as he sits down to await death, knowing that he saved mankind, the marine then receives an off-planet transmission from the survivors in orbit, who have managed to find out where the armies of Hell are coming from. The message reveals that the demonic base is in the center of the marine's own hometown. He then fights through the city until he reaches the base, but sees there is no way to stop the invasion on that side. He then decides to step into the portal to try deactivating it from the other side, entering Hell (a different Hell than the one that the Deimos moon floats over in the first Doom). 
 
After fighting through the hordes of Hell, the marine reaches the location of the biggest demon he has ever seen, called the Icon of Sin (Baphomet). He kills the Icon of Sin by firing rockets into its exposed brain. Its death causes devastation on Hell, and the portal to Earth has been sealed. Now with Hell defeated, the marine joins with the other humans in an effort to rebuild and restore life on Earth.","Let the Obsession begin. Again.

The player inspects would-be immigrants' documents and uses a sparse array of tools to determine whether the papers are in order for the purpose of keeping spies, smugglers and other unwanted individuals out of the country. At the end of each in-game day, the player earns money based on how many immigrants they processed less any penalties for mistakes, and then must decide on a simple budget to spend that money on rent, food, heat, and other necessities in low-class housing for themselves and their family. As relations between Arstotzka and nearby countries deteriorate due to multiple terrorist attacks, each day introduces a new set of rules for immigration based on the game's story, such as denying citizens of specific countries or demanding more exacting identification from citizens. The player may be challenged with moral dilemmas and social engineering as the game progresses; such as allowing the supposed spouse of one immigrant through despite them lacking complete papers, even though they may be planning to attack your fellow guards. 
A mysterious anti-government organisation also appears, with several of its members appearing in the checkpoint, giving the inspector orders on what to do in order to help the organisation bring down the government and establish a new one; the player can choose whether or not to help this organisation. 
The game has a scripted story mode with multiple possible endings depending on the player's previous actions, as well as an unlockable, randomized endless-play mode. 
Papers, Please has been praised by the sense of immersion provided by the game mechanics, and the intense emotional reaction.[12] CBC News' Jonathan Ore called Papers, Please a ""nerve-racking sleuthing game with relentless pacing and dozens of compelling characters - all from a desk job""","Papers, Please was developed by Lucas Pope beginning in November, 2012 using the Haxe programming language and the NME framework, both open-source. As an American living in Japan, Pope dealt with immigration in his international travels and thought the experience, which he describes as ""tense"", could be made into a fun game. Before release, Pope had set up a name submission form for the public, where people could submit their own names to be randomly assigned to scripted characters in the game. Papers, Please was submitted to Steam Greenlight on April 11, 2013 and was greenlit on May 1.","Any[17, 20, 22, 268435458, 268435465, 268435468, 268435469, 268435487, 268435488, 536870955, 536871029, 536871115, 536871195, 536871341, 536871342, 536871343, 536871344, 536871906, 536871939, 536872070, 536872131, 536872406, 536872617, 536872873, 536873405, 536873787, 536874916, 536875062, 536875063, 536875067, 536875168, 536875531, 536876632, 536878141, 536878206, 536878408, 536878409]",Any[476],Any[1],Null,"Any[76374, 90608]","Any[3, 6, 14, 39, 46]","Any[9835, 10774, 18011, 18182, 22387, 24426, 25222, 33153, 56033]","Papers, Please"

Xardas sends the Hero to Lord Hagen, leader of the paladins, to retrieve the Eye of Innos, an artifact which makes it possible to speak with the dragons and learn more about their motivation. The Nameless Hero starts to the City of Khorinis and after he found a way to enter the city, he learns he has to join one of the factions – the militia, the fire mages or the mercenaries – to be permitted entrance to Lord Hagen. When finally meeting the head of the paladins, the Nameless Hero is first sent into the mine valley, which is now overrun by Orcs, to bring back evidence of the dragons. In the castle, the former old camp, Garond heads the mission of the paladins. He also knows about the dragons, since the castle has already been attacked by them, but is only willing to write a notice on it for Lord Hagen, after the Nameless Hero has gathered information on the status in the mines. By the time the Hero exits the valley with the note about the dragons, the evil forces have become aware of his quest. Seekers are spread throughout the isle, with the goal to kill him. Presented with the note Lord Hagen is willing to give the Eye of Innos to the Hero and sends him to the monastery of the fire mages to retrieve it. But shortly before the Hero arrives there, the eye was stolen. The Hero chases after the thief, but just arrives in time to witness Seekers destroy the Eye of Innos. A smith can repair the amulet, but for the magical power to be restored, a ritual with high mages representing the three gods is necessary. Vatras, the water mage, prepares the ritual and represents Adanos. With former fire mage Xardas representing Beliar, Pyrokar, head of the fire mages, joins the ritual reluctantly to represent Innos. The mages manage to restore the power of the Eye of Innos and so the Hero can head back to the valley to destroy the four dragons that live there. After all of the dragons are killed, the Hero travels to Xardas' tower to report to him, but the mage is gone. The Hero is given a note from Xardas by Lester, telling him he was to find more information in the fire mages' monastery, in the book 'The Halls of Irdorath'. The book contains a sea map, showing the way to the isle Irdorath, one of the ancient temples of Beliar that once disappeared.

The development team aims to push for true simulation,both in the sense of the physics system but also in allowing the player to open any door or drawer they'd logically be able to and examine what's inside, down to small details.","Any[31, 43, 268435458, 268435487, 268435488, 536870984, 536871029, 536871081, 536871447, 536871874, 536871878, 536871939, 536872010, 536872070, 536872222, 536872405, 536872406, 536872533, 536872609, 536872638, 536872647, 536872712, 536872715, 536872810, 536872843, 536872964, 536873273, 536873362, 536873454, 536873973, 536874115, 536874452, 536874813, 536875046, 536875050, 536875057, 536875060, 536875096, 536875098, 536875107, 536875110, 536875112, 536875113, 536875114, 536875116, 536875157, 536875182, 536875199, 536875207, 536875208, 536875215, 536875216, 536875219, 536875231, 536875236, 536875242, 536875244, 536875260, 536875271, 536875275, 536875286, 536875287, 536875304, 536875315, 536875322, 536875328, 536875330, 536875335, 536875340, 536875342, 536875362, 536875364, 536875420, 536875488, 536875490, 536875492, 536875494, 536875501, 536875502, 536875503, 536875504, 536875505, 536875506, 536875507, 536875508, 536875510, 536875511, 536875512, 536875513, 536875524, 536875529, 536875531, 536875534, 536875537, 536875540, 536875541, 536875545, 536875546, 536875553, 536875638, 536875639, 536875737, 536875741, 536875745, 536875747, 536875750, 536875808, 536875831, 536875893, 536875900, 536875903, 536875937, 536875951, 536876014, 536876073, 536876075, 536876097, 536876098, 536876109, 536876126, 536876129, 536876130, 536876168, 536876173, 536876178, 536876179, 536876180, 536876183, 536876184, 536876185, 536876187, 536876188, 536876191, 536876196, 536876199, 536876287, 536876294, 536876320, 536876332, 536876338, 536876340, 536876425, 536876454, 536876462, 536876466, 536876474, 536876481, 536876493, 536876521, 536876557, 536876616, 536876623, 536876625, 536876654, 536876680, 536876701, 536876854, 536876895, 536876896, 536877043, 536877173, 536877268, 536877316, 536877320, 536877341, 536877344, 536877371, 536877385, 536877389, 536877390, 536877392, 536877393, 536877542, 536877587, 536877704, 536877844, 536877864, 536878041, 536878063, 536878065, 536878066, 536878067, 536878141, 536878231, 536878318, 536878339, 536878463, 536878482, 536878565, 536878589, 536878590, 536879027, 536879029, 536879645, 536879958, 536880098, 536880241, 536880565, 536880644, 536881628, 536882255, 536882256, 536894768]",Any[13],Any[1],Null,"Any[37609, 69146, 69147]","Any[3, 6, 14, 39, 45, 48, 49, 130]","Any[533, 1882, 2993, 3188, 9498, 9727, 9730, 11270, 12482]",Gone Home

Thirteen can be accessed in the game and one, Disney Castle, is shown in cutscenes. Additional worlds are mentioned by various characters but are inaccessible because they have been destroyed by the Heartless. Ten Disney worlds are based on fiction, primarily from the Disney animated features canon, and the other four were created by Square specifically for the game. 
 
The graphics and characters of each world were designed to resemble the artwork style of each Disney film. Each Disney world is inhabited by characters from the film: including Hercules and Philoctetes in Olympus Coliseum, and Aladdin, Princess Jasmine and Jafar in Agrabah. Each world is disconnected from the others and exists separately. Most characters in the world are unaware of other ones, with few exceptions. Players travel from one world to another via Gummi Ship. 
 
The worlds created specifically for the game mirror the overall appearance of the other worlds and feature either new characters or ones from several Final Fantasy games. The new worlds include: the Destiny Islands, where the story opens; Traverse Town, which serves as a launching point for most of the game; Hollow Bastion, which many of the Final Fantasy characters call home; and the End of the World, a large, dark world created from the remnants of various worlds consumed by the Heartless. The main characters travel from world to world to seal each ""Keyhole""; this protects the world from the Heartless and ultimately from destruction. They also try to minimize their interaction with characters of other worlds to maintain a balance of separation. This sometimes requires Sora, Donald and Goofy to blend in with the world inhabitants by changing their physical appearance. 
 
Kingdom Hearts begins with Sora's Dive to the Heart, which foreshadows the events that will soon take place, but soon progresses to Destiny Islands, where Sora lives with his two best friends, Riku and Kairi. The three friends seek to leave the islands to explore new worlds and have prepared a raft for this purpose. One night, the islands are attacked by darkness and shadow creatures. Sora seeks out his friends, finding Riku first; Riku disappears into darkness, curious about what it contains. Soon after, Sora obtains a mysterious weapon, the Keyblade, to defend himself. Using it to fend off the creatures, he heads for a secret cave, where he finds Kairi near a door. She turns to him, saying his name as the door behind her blows open. The ensuing blast of darkness sends Sora and Kairi both out of the cave. The islands are soon destroyed, and Sora is left adrift, Riku and Kairi's whereabouts unknown.","The premise of Kingdom Hearts is designed around traveling to a collection of levels that are both original designs, and based on various Disney stories, referred to in-game as ""Worlds"". The Worlds are populated by NPC's, based on relevant characters from the corresponding Disney story, for example, the World based on Disney's Alice in Wonderland features appearances by Alice, the White Rabbit, and the Queen of Hearts. Interacting with these characters forms part of gameplay, while combating the games enemies, the ""Heartless"" forms the other. 
 
Successful completion of a World is accomplished by defeating a key foe, which is either the primary villain from the Disney story, a unique Heartless of particular strength, or a combination thereof. Each world has a key foe which must be defeated, although there are many mini-bosses, side quests and treasures to be found that contribute to character progression within the game, and give bonuses for their completion in the form of weapons, items, and bonus scenes. 
 
The game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game. Levels are gained with experience, and provide increases to stat attributes in strength, defence, magic, hit points, magic points and ability points, with a new, predetermined ability unlocked approximately every four levels. Enemies also drop a combination of four types of reward upon death, green orbs that replenish HP, blue, translucent bubbles that replenish MP, yellow diamonds that contribute funds to the in-game currency ""Munny"", and tiny chests that when picked up, add a item to the players inventory based on the foe defeated.

Only Crash Bandicoot survives with brain intact, now knowing that Neo Cortex is the real bad guy. Cortex notices the threat that Crash may cause, and banishes Crash to another island.

Players control the titular protagonist, Crash, as he traverses several levels in sequence in order to progress. Crash is able to defeat enemies by either jumping on them or using a spinning attack that launches them. Crash will lose a life if he is hit by an enemy or obstacle, or falls into a bottomless pit. Crash can protect himself by collecting Aku Aku masks, which protect Crash from a single hit from an enemy or obstacle (but not pits or other instant-death obstacles). Crash can hold onto two masks at a time and, upon collecting a third mask, will gain temporary invincibility. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, with more lives earned by finding extra life items or by collecting 100 Wumpa Fruits.","Any[1, 18, 268435464, 268435487, 536871213, 536871306, 536871364, 536871470, 536871577, 536871701, 536871882, 536871931, 536872225, 536872961, 536873021, 536873111, 536873455, 536873671, 536874398, 536874745, 536875050, 536875073, 536875074, 536875076, 536875081, 536875088, 536875095, 536875151, 536875152, 536875199, 536875209, 536875213, 536875271, 536875284, 536875310, 536875376, 536875389, 536875394, 536875396, 536875488, 536875621, 536875638, 536875639, 536875699, 536875702, 536875714, 536875791, 536875803, 536875819, 536875830, 536875870, 536875902, 536875921, 536876120, 536876207, 536876270, 536876331, 536876348, 536876353, 536876357, 536876526, 536876551, 536876570, 536876619, 536876717, 536876874, 536876943, 536876952, 536877048, 536877049, 536877058, 536877230, 536877490, 536877801, 536878147, 536878197, 536878430, 536878439, 536878505, 536878567, 536878594, 536879026, 536879993, 536880276, 536880311, 536880417, 536880441, 536883092, 536883451, 536883590, 536883622, 536884169, 536884403, 536886533]",Null,Any[1],Null,"Any[2841, 2842]","Any[7, 45]","Any[843, 1186, 1187, 1189, 1192, 1528, 1576, 1577, 3166]",Crash Bandicoot

They are spent by finding the appropriate teacher. Several skills have only one ""level"" (Sneaking, Acrobatics), while the fighting skills (one-handed weapons, two-handed weapons, bows and crossbows) have two proficiency levels. If the Hero chooses to be a Mage (or joins the Swamp Camp), he will be able to learn Circles of Magic; of which there are 6. The main attributes are increased in 1 or 5 point increments, starting at 10 and capping off at 100. The cap can be surpassed with the use of potions. 
 
The game places a special focus on the interactivity of the environment. For example, hunting wild animals can earn the player raw meat. This heals damage and can be sold. However, by using a stove or frying pan, the player may also choose to turn this into grilled meat, which heals much more effectively. Similarly, most of the activities other characters can be seen doing (playing musical instruments, stirring soup pots, urinating etc.) can be done by the main character as well (although with the exception of forging weapons these activities have little bearing on the game). 
 
The player can choose which camp to join, although quests get increasingly linear and the distinctions between different factions wane in the latter parts of the game. The major difference is that Swamp Camp members cannot become mages, because they are limited to 4 magic circles (out of 6). However, they gain access to magic earlier.","Gothic is a single-player action role-playing video game for Windows developed by the German company Piranha Bytes. It was first released in Germany on March 15, 2001, followed by the English North American release eight months later on November 23, 2001, and the Polish release on March 28, 2002. 
 
Gothic has been well received by critics, scoring an average of 80% and 81/100 on Game Rankings' and Metacritic's aggregates, respectively. Reviewers credited the game for its story, complex interaction with other in-game characters, and graphics, but criticized it for the difficult control scheme and high system requirements.","Any[1, 17, 21, 22, 38, 268435468, 268435487, 536870999, 536871008, 536871044, 536871063, 536871086, 536871087, 536871133, 536871134, 536871138, 536871208, 536871249, 536871251, 536871252, 536871283, 536871301, 536871422, 536871449, 536871817, 536871938, 536871944, 536871945, 536872014, 536872039, 536872371, 536872435, 536872581, 536872628, 536872666, 536872798, 536872873, 536873066, 536873089, 536873192, 536873338, 536873364, 536873384, 536873580, 536873949, 536874134, 536874414, 536875083, 536875161, 536875162, 536875196, 536875214, 536875257, 536875271, 536875275, 536875304, 536875316, 536875319, 536875332, 536875436, 536875437, 536875453, 536875455, 536875494, 536875496, 536875527, 536875531, 536875537, 536875549, 536875609, 536875657, 536875762, 536875770, 536875778, 536875791, 536875830, 536875932, 536875956, 536876014, 536876033, 536876036, 536876058, 536876084, 536876121, 536876168, 536876220, 536876298, 536876318, 536876384, 536876400, 536876413, 536876429, 536876444, 536876454, 536876490, 536876507, 536876511, 536876571, 536876585, 536876586, 536876606, 536876607, 536876620, 536876621, 536876629, 536876760, 536876848, 536876879, 536876991, 536877028, 536877040, 536877184, 536877209, 536877233, 536877276, 536877339, 536877443, 536877519, 536877562, 536877569, 536877599, 536877612, 536877614, 536877616, 536877645, 536877691, 536877724, 536877760, 536877931, 536877955, 536877960, 536877965, 536877997, 536878009, 536878086, 536878227, 536878256, 536878449, 536878505, 536878531, 536879111, 536879195, 536879590, 536879704, 536879758, 536879788, 536879896, 536880218, 536880540, 536880694, 536880884, 536880907, 536881166, 536881173, 536881458, 536881534, 536881995, 536882259, 536882272, 536882470, 536882730, 536883035, 536883728, 536884433, 536884869, 536884890, 536886359, 536886360, 536886362, 536886363, 536887091, 536887509, 536887510, 536887511]",Any[134],Any[1],Null,"Any[5818, 20447, 20448, 20449, 20450]",Any[6],"Any[6, 472, 832, 1593, 1942, 2262, 2263, 3025, 7346]",Gothic

A squadron of the Tekken Force searches an ancient temple located in Mexico. Soon after arriving there, Heihachi learns that they have been obliterated by Ogre. However, Heihachi, having witnessed the event, seeks to capture Ogre in hopes of harnessing its power for his own gain. Soon after, various martial artists end up dead, attacked or missing from all over the world, with Ogre behind it. 
 
Jun Kazama has been living a quiet life in Yakushima with her young son, Jin, fathered after the events of the previous tournament by Heihachi's son, Kazuya. However, their peaceful life is disrupted when Jun begins to feel the encroaching presence of Ogre. Jun is now a target and instructs Jin to seek Heihachi should anything happen. Sometime after Jin's fifteenth birthday, Ogre indeed attacks. Against Jun's wishes, Jin valiantly tries to fight Ogre off, but Ogre knocks him unconscious. When Jin awakens, he finds that his house has been burned to the ground, and that his mother is missing and most likely dead. Driven by revenge, Jin is confronted by the Devil, which brands Jin's left arm and possesses him. Jin goes to Heihachi, explaining his situation and identity and begging him for training to become strong enough to face Ogre. Heihachi accepts and takes Jin in, as well as sending him to school. 
 
Four years later, Jin masters the Mishima karate style. On Jin's nineteenth birthday, Heihachi announces the King of the Iron Fist Tournament 3, secretly intending to lure out Ogre, while Jin prepares for his upcoming battle. 
 
In the tournament, at a large temple, Paul Phoenix defeats Ogre and walks away from the tournament, thinking he is victorious. However, Ogre transforms into its true form of a monstrous beast, and Jin finally confronts it. Jin battles and defeats Ogre, and the being completely dissolves. However, Jin is suddenly gunned down by a squadron of Tekken Forces led by Heihachi, who, no longer needing him, personally fires a final shot into his grandson's head. 
 
However, Jin, revived by the Devil within him, reawakens and dispatches the soldiers, smashing Heihachi through the wall of the temple. Heihachi survives the long fall, looking up to see Jin sprout feathery wings and fly off into the night.","Tekken 3 maintains the same core fighting system and concept as its predecessors, but brings many improvements, such as significantly more detailed graphics and animations, fifteen new characters added to the game's roster, more modern music and faster and more fluid gameplay. 
Perhaps the most noticeable change from Tekken 2 fight system is movement reform - whereas the element of depth had been largely insignificant in previous Tekken games (aside from some characters having unique sidesteps and dodging maneuvers), Tekken 3 added emphasis on the third axis, allowing all characters to sidestep in or out of the background by lightly pressing the arcade stick (or tapping the controller button in the console version) towards the corresponding direction. Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn't connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws. 
 
Tekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat 'em up minigame called ""Tekken Force"", which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first). This was continued in Tekken 4 and succeeded by the Devil Within minigame in Tekken 5 - but Boskonovitch was dropped as a playable character after Tekken 3. There is also a minigame ""Tekken Ball"", similar to beach volleyball, where one has to hit the ball with a powerful attack to hurt the opponent or try to hit the ball in such a way that it hits the ground in the opponent's area, thus causing damage.","Any[1, 268435460, 536870933, 536870973, 536871019, 536871186, 536871213, 536871470, 536871889, 536872143, 536872152, 536872225, 536872733, 536872862, 536872897, 536872898, 536873274, 536873715, 536873863, 536875073, 536875125, 536875133, 536875178, 536875183, 536875189, 536875194, 536875198, 536875206, 536875271, 536875353, 536875393, 536875446, 536875453, 536875456, 536875482, 536875486, 536875491, 536875716, 536875778, 536875803, 536875809, 536875815, 536875832, 536875870, 536875895, 536875914, 536875919, 536875941, 536876099, 536876216, 536876235, 536876266, 536876413, 536876471, 536876490, 536876612, 536876734, 536876735, 536876803, 536876818, 536876823, 536876927, 536876982, 536876996, 536877000, 536877007, 536877008, 536877009, 536877012, 536877016, 536877058, 536877237, 536877277, 536877311, 536877386, 536877406, 536877408, 536877416, 536877441, 536877443, 536877444, 536877445, 536877446, 536877447, 536877448, 536877449, 536877804, 536877938, 536877943, 536877996, 536878112, 536878212, 536878257, 536878299, 536878392, 536878502, 536878562, 536879870, 536880067, 536880441, 536880648, 536880761, 536880843, 536880848, 536880994, 536881426, 536881581, 536882222, 536882224, 536882226, 536882361, 536882449, 536882678, 536882765, 536882766, 536882767, 536882786, 536882787, 536882830, 536884031, 536884032, 536884033, 536884863, 536885296, 536887631]",Null,"Any[1, 2]",Null,"Any[2780, 50934, 50935]","Any[7, 8, 52]","Any[1240, 1242, 1243, 1245, 1246, 1247, 1249, 1563, 1621]",Tekken 3

The game builds upon the previous installment, following a similar 3D level-design convention inspired from the 2D platformer titles where players must navigate through a linear-designed level within a time limit to reach a level's Goal Pole. One key aspect introduced in this title is the simultaneous multiplayer: while not the first game in the series to do so, it is the first 3D title in the Mario series to incorporate up to four players cooperating with each other to reach the goal. Players can select their character from a pool of playable characters prior to starting the game, and each of these characters have their own unique playstyle that gives them advantages and disadvantages over other characters. The game makes use of several Wii U exclusive features, such as tapping blocks with the touch screen on the GamePad and blowing into the mic to reveal hidden items and blow away enemies. Various new power-ups are introduced in this title, with the trademark suit being the Cat power-up, which enables characters to perform a melee attack, climb up walls, and leap while midair, as well as the game generally having a cat-based theme.","Any[1, 268435464, 268435487, 536871501, 536871971, 536872098, 536872120, 536872211, 536872293, 536872961, 536872983, 536873021, 536873064, 536873192, 536874398, 536874775, 536874911, 536875056, 536875125, 536875130, 536875156, 536875175, 536875194, 536875197, 536875201, 536875209, 536875214, 536875241, 536875258, 536875271, 536875286, 536875308, 536875350, 536875391, 536875392, 536875396, 536875421, 536875422, 536875437, 536875491, 536875525, 536875590, 536875610, 536875611, 536875623, 536875629, 536875670, 536875698, 536875713, 536875754, 536875803, 536875823, 536875830, 536875837, 536875842, 536875843, 536875844, 536875845, 536875856, 536875903, 536875921, 536875934, 536876217, 536876218, 536876235, 536876270, 536876448, 536876496, 536876499, 536876639, 536876713, 536876751, 536876752, 536876925, 536876952, 536876989, 536877041, 536877047, 536877048, 536877049, 536877050, 536877051, 536877052, 536877053, 536877054, 536877055, 536877056, 536877057, 536877058, 536877059, 536877060, 536877061, 536877062, 536877063, 536877064, 536877065, 536877066, 536877067, 536877068, 536877069, 536877070, 536877071, 536877072, 536877073, 536877074, 536877075, 536877076, 536877077, 536877078, 536877079, 536877080, 536877081, 536877082, 536877083, 536877084, 536877085, 536877086, 536877087, 536877088, 536877089, 536877090, 536877091, 536877092, 536877093, 536877094, 536877095, 536877096, 536881843]",Null,"Any[1, 2, 3]",Any[7713],"Any[4622, 69096, 98976]",Any[41],"Any[358, 1068, 1074, 1077, 1078, 1079, 2350, 3349, 26758]",Super Mario 3D World

It featured revolutionary pre-rendered 3D graphics that give the game a very unique look compared to most other games on consoles at the time. The two playable characters featured in the game are the titular character, Donkey Kong and his nephew, Diddy Kong. Together the two swing, climb, jump, swim, cartwheel, ride animals, and blast out of barrels on their way to recover their stolen bannanas from the evil King K. Rool and his Kremling army.

On a quest to rebuild the Jedi Order, you must pick up the pieces of your shattered past to complete your training, develop new powerful Force abilities and master the art of the iconic lightsaber - all while staying one step ahead of the Empire and its deadly Inquisitors. 
 
While mastering your abilities, players will engage in cinematically charged lightsaber and Force combat designed to deliver the kind of intense Star Wars lightsaber battles as seen in the films. Players will need to approach enemies strategically, sizing up strengths and weaknesses while cleverly utilizing your Jedi training to overcome your opponents and solve the mysteries that lay in your path. 
 
Star Wars fans will recognize iconic locations, weapons, gear and enemies while also meeting a roster of fresh characters, locations, creatures, droids and adversaries new to Star Wars. As part of this authentic Star Wars story, fans will delve into a galaxy recently seized by the Empire. As a Jedi hero-turned-fugitive, players will need to fight for survival while exploring the mysteries of a long-extinct civilization all in an effort to rebuild the remnants of the Jedi Order as the Empire seeks to erase the Jedi completely.","Any[1, 17, 18, 268435487, 536871808, 536871886]",Any[439],Any[1],Null,"Any[82783, 82784]","Any[6, 48, 49, 203]","Any[55038, 55984, 81249, 96217, 101608, 106987, 113360, 114009, 119171]",Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order

A Fracture in time, created by a time travel experiment that has gone wrong, is advancing at an inexorable pace. As a result, time itself is now stuttering to a halt and then restarting, causing the world to turn into a frozen tableau. Most are unaware of the imminent disaster. 
 
Jack Joyce is not one of these people: changed by the same experiment, he can see the damage as the Fracture advances; time keeps slipping more and more out of joint and as the world loses synchronization, destruction on a massive scale ensues. Jack is desperately trying to find a way to prevent the Fracture from reaching its conclusion – that final moment when the last grain of sand in the hourglass tumbles down, and time ends. But his best friend Paul Serene and the ruthless Monarch Solutions have their own plans, and Jack’s efforts don’t line up with them. They are willing to use whatever means necessary to stop him.""","Fix Time Before It Destroys Everything! 
 
When time breaks, catastrophe becomes your playground. As hero Jack Joyce, you'll fight your way through epic disasters that stutter back and forth in time. But surviving this unstable world--and halting the end of time itself--is only possible by mastering your new time powers.

Recently, inexplicable events have been plaguing this quiet place, which has long become a large library where men of wisdom and knowledge can study in peace. Unknown mercenaries try to enter the walls of Candlekeep, interested in a seemingly ordinary and unimportant young person - an orphan who was taken in by the mage Gorion and treated by him as his own child. One night, Gorion decides to leave Candlekeep and take his adopted child to a safe place. However, as they leave the fortress, they are ambushed by a group of assassins. The orphan manages to escape, but Gorion dies in battle. 
 
The gates of Candlekeep are locked, because its inhabitants are afraid to attract to themselves the wrath of the mysterious attackers. Only Imoen, another child who was brought up by Gorion and has been like a sister to the protagonist, is willing to share the uncertain future. The two have nothing, no place to call their home, only a wide hostile world in front of them. A long and perilous journey begins there. 
 
Baldur's Gate is a role-playing game that uses the rule set of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D). Set in the universe of Forgotten Realms, the game is the first part of the saga that lets the player explore various towns, wilderness areas and dungeons, undertake many side quests, and find companions for the long journey. The player creates the hero(ine) by selecting his or her class, choosing between fighter, thief, mage, priest, ranger, and druid (including sub-classes, dual- and multi-class characters); alignment (Good-Evil and Lawful-Chaotic axis), and weapon proficiencies. The 2nd edition AD&D rules are applied in the game during combat, character leveling, class restrictions, etc. 
 
Up to six player-controlled characters can participate in combat. Battles occur in the same environment as exploration, and flow in real time, though the player is able to pause combat at any time to issue precise commands to any of the characters. Once the game is unpaused, the characters repeat the last action selected by the player until it is changed or becomes impossible to execute. Characters can freely move during battles; party formation and positioning in combat play a significant role.","Baldur's Gate is a fantasy role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published in 1998 by Interplay Entertainment. It is the first game in the Baldur's Gate series and takes place in the Forgotten Realms, a high fantasy campaign setting, using a modified version of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) 2nd edition rules. It was the first game to use the Infinity Engine for its graphics, with Interplay using the engine for other Forgotten Realms-licensed games, including the Icewind Dale series, as well as other licensed D&D campaign worlds such as Planescape: Torment. The game's story focuses on players controlling a protagonist of their own creation who finds themselves travelling across the Sword Coast alongside a party of companions, to unravel the mystery surrounding a sudden iron crisis affecting the region and attempting to discover the culprits behind it, all while uncovering dark secrets about their origins and dealing with attempts on their life.","Any[17, 268435468, 536871307, 536872926, 536874921, 536881062]",Any[28],"Any[1, 3]",Null,"Any[11, 12, 13, 18471]","Any[3, 6, 14, 39]","Any[54775, 96217, 99118, 103303, 106987, 112191, 113636, 115278, 115653]",Baldur's Gate

They offer this as a ""wish fulfillment"" service to people on their death beds. Since these artificial memories conflict with the patient's real memories, the procedure is only legal to do on people without much time left to live. 
 
Sigmund Corp. employees Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts are tasked with fulfilling the lifelong dream of the dying Johnny Wyles. Johnny wants to go to the moon, although he doesn't know why. The doctors insert themselves into an interactive compilation of his memories and traverse backwards through his life via mementos. With each leap to an important moment in Johnny's memories, they learn more about him and what brought him to his current position in life, including his largely unhappy marriage to his childhood sweetheart, River. Upon reaching his childhood, the doctors attempt to insert his desire to go to the moon. Supposedly, Johnny's mind would create new memories based on that desire, and Johnny would die believing he lived without any regrets. 
 
However, Johnny's mind does not create the new memories as planned. Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosalene must solve the problem to fulfill Johnny's dying wish of going to the moon. 
 
Eventually, it is revealed that Johnny and River met as children at a carnival. They looked at the night sky and made up a constellation: a rabbit with the moon as its belly. The two agreed to meet at the same place the following year, with Johnny promising that should he forget or get lost, the two would ""regroup on the moon"". That night, Johnny gives River a toy platypus which River treasures for the rest of her life. Shortly after, Johnny's twin brother Joey was killed in an accident. Johnny's mother gave him beta blockers to induce memory loss of the tragic event, also causing him to forget his first encounter with River. He later happened to meet her again, and eventually marry her, and River only realized later on that he had forgot their meeting at the carnival. (Johnny confessed that he approached her in school because she was different, and revealed that he thought that was their first meeting) River, diagnosed as an adult with Asperger syndrome (although never directly stated, the game references Tony Attwood, who wrote numerous books about Aspergers), did not tell Johnny directly about their first meeting; instead, she tried to indirectly jostle his memories by cutting her hair and crafting paper bunnies, including a dual-colored one representing the constellation they made up during their first encounter, combined with the blue-and-yellow dress she wore on their wedding. River was unable to make Johnny remember before she died, and Johnny was left with lingering guilt and an inexplicable desire to go to the Moon. 
 
In the present, Rosalene and Watts eventually implant a memory sequence in which Joey did not die, and lived on to become a popular author, and Johnny did not meet River again until they started working together at NASA. As the comatose real-life Johnny begins to die, he imagines going on a moon mission with River. During the launch, River holds out a hand to him. The moon appears through a window on the ship, and Johnny takes her hand as his heart monitor flatlines. 
 
In the epilogue, Johnny and River eventually get married, and build and retire to the same house where the real-life Johnny and River lived. Back in the real world, Rosalene and Watts look to Johnny's grave, which is placed adjacent to River’s. They reveal to the audience that Johnny willed the house to his caregiver, Lily. Rosalene receives a phone call, and the two move on to their next patient. While Watts is leaving, he stops and the screen briefly flashes red, the same way it did when Johnny felt pain. Watts takes some painkillers, then continues onward.","Join Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts as they enter a patient named Johnny's mind on his death bed to grant his final request.

The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (""badniks"" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground. 
 
Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection. 
 
The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress. 
 
At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues). 
 
When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a ""Secret Zone"" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a ""goal block"" (which ends the level).","Any[1, 18, 268435464, 268435487, 536870990, 536871208, 536871294, 536871298, 536871447, 536871487, 536871751, 536871882, 536871945, 536872098, 536872961, 536873096, 536874398, 536875046, 536875073, 536875081, 536875088, 536875209, 536875213, 536875301, 536875367, 536875370, 536875371, 536875434, 536875490, 536875623, 536875638, 536875678, 536875740, 536875819, 536875830, 536875852, 536875886, 536876105, 536876257, 536876332, 536876515, 536876545, 536876546, 536876751, 536877730, 536877940, 536878299, 536878483, 536880042, 536880227, 536881262, 536882346]",Null,Any[1],Null,"Any[8210, 35597, 71943]","Any[5, 6, 9, 12, 29, 34, 39, 47]","Any[3222, 4438, 6231, 19150, 21062, 26855, 36198, 55190, 56033]",Sonic the Hedgehog

Which is a spin off series of the Shin Megami Tensei series. Starting with Persona 3, the series became popular for its combination of traditional RPG mechanics, and social simulation gameplay. By day the player attends high school. By night the game becomes a dungeon crawling turn based RPG. In Persona 4 the player assumes the role of the player-named protagonist who has transferred to a new school in the fictional rural Japanese town of Inaba. The protagonist gains the ability to summon Personas, a power that allows the protagonist to fight Shadows, the enemies of the game. 
 
Like Persona 3, Persona 4 requires the player to manage their time wisely. As most actions in the game will result in time advancing. Passage of time is not based on how long the player takes to do their actions. Once the player has chosen what they will do, time will pass. When time passes it simply skips to the next part of the day. Each day is split into multiple parts: Early Morning, Morning, Lunch, Daytime, Afternoon, After School, and the Evening. Players can choose to spend time with friends, study, read books, fish, and many other side activities. Note that shopping does not cause time to pass. 
 
On schooldays the player attends school, where there is usually a lecture about random factoids of real life that you will be quizzed on. Getting these questions right or wrong does not effect the main story, but raises the characters Knowledge social stat, which can be used to unlock dialogue options in some cutscenes, and get higher test scores. Other social stats, include: Understanding, Courage, Expression, and Diligence. Each of these stats have many various effects on the players side activities. Some social links require certain levels of social stats. Increasing your social stats can unlock more part time jobs for the player to earn more money. After school and on weekends the player chooses what to do with their free time, 
 
At night, the player can traverse dungeons. Where they will fight many different types of Shadows. The combat is very similar to any traditional turn based Japanese RPG game. Persona 4 uses a combat system akin to the Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne ""Press Turn"" system. In which the player can take advantage of the enemies weaknesses to gain extra turns. If the player attacks an enemy with an element that enemy is weak to, the player gains an extra turn to attack. However, repeating that attack on the same enemy will not give the character a second extra turn. 
 
The game features a very complex but easy to use fusing system. The player selects multiple personas to fuse together to create a new persona that can sometimes carry over some of the base personas skills. Later into the game the player can unlock Special Fusions to create Peronas that are very powerful. 
 
Social Links are one of the key mechanics in this game. Social Links are a measure of the friendship between the protagonist and the many characters of Persona 4. This feature gives your fused Personas bonus experience upon their creation, and allow you to learn new skills and abilities in battle. Social Links also open up romantic relationship options with a few of the games female characters. Social Links play out as the normal cutscenes in the game that provide more character development for the huge cast of characters. There are 24 Social Links in total, each one has a respective Arcana. All Personas have an assigned Arcana. Having a Persona of the same Arcana of a Social Link doubles the rate that you level that Social Link. 
 
Persona 4's plot is closely tied to the weather, thus the player can check the ingame weather forecast. Weather has various effects on the game, on rainy days if the player chooses to study they will gain more Knowledge points than normal. The most essential part of the weather forecast is recognizing when the town will become foggy, as this is an indication of when the player must finish the dungeon they are currently exploring. If the player fails to complete a dungeon before a foggy day the game rolls the calender back one week. The fog sets in after 2 or more rainy days.","Any[17, 27, 31, 34, 38, 268435468, 268435469, 268435470, 268435490, 536870955, 536870970, 536870973, 536870988, 536870990, 536871006, 536871015, 536871052, 536871086, 536871087, 536871088, 536871127, 536871133, 536871138, 536871139, 536871148, 536871156, 536871170, 536871208, 536871262, 536871270, 536871308, 536871327, 536871390, 536871409, 536871420, 536871421, 536871457, 536871470, 536871472, 536871496, 536871670, 536871758, 536871839, 536871865, 536871938, 536871958, 536872098, 536872100, 536872214, 536872225, 536872280, 536872371, 536872396, 536872416, 536872417, 536872418, 536872424, 536872425, 536872426, 536872435, 536872563, 536872581, 536872647, 536872712, 536872865, 536872928, 536872983, 536873066, 536873079, 536873082, 536873111, 536873154, 536873350, 536873364, 536873473, 536873513, 536873516, 536873591, 536873736, 536873890, 536874343, 536874398, 536874745, 536874822, 536874873, 536875055, 536875058, 536875074, 536875075, 536875080, 536875081, 536875091, 536875098, 536875099, 536875153, 536875178, 536875196, 536875199, 536875200, 536875232, 536875233, 536875241, 536875247, 536875250, 536875260, 536875261, 536875264, 536875265, 536875271, 536875275, 536875300, 536875307, 536875313, 536875317, 536875318, 536875325, 536875326, 536875330, 536875340, 536875341, 536875344, 536875356, 536875362, 536875372, 536875377, 536875380, 536875389, 536875409, 536875420, 536875433, 536875436, 536875448, 536875449, 536875453, 536875455, 536875494, 536875506, 536875507, 536875523, 536875525, 536875537, 536875568, 536875580, 536875581, 536875590, 536875607, 536875621, 536875622, 536875626, 536875639, 536875650, 536875662, 536875667, 536875699, 536875700, 536875705, 536875743, 536875746, 536875749, 536875750, 536875757, 536875762, 536875767, 536875770, 536875778, 536875803, 536875822, 536875833, 536875873, 536875882, 536875896, 536875923, 536875930, 536875934, 536875941, 536876016, 536876063, 536876073, 536876087, 536876091, 536876095, 536876096, 536876098, 536876109, 536876125, 536876130, 536876170, 536876176, 536876180, 536876201, 536876210, 536876232, 536876241, 536876284, 536876306, 536876307, 536876309, 536876311, 536876312, 536876313, 536876316, 536876317, 536876332, 536876338, 536876341, 536876375, 536876422, 536876427, 536876428, 536876430, 536876471, 536876473, 536876474, 536876479, 536876489, 536876495, 536876499, 536876504, 536876509, 536876511, 536876546, 536876567, 536876589, 536876596, 536876606, 536876620, 536876629, 536876636, 536876646, 536876647, 536876665, 536876666, 536876668, 536876722, 536876752, 536876758, 536876767, 536876770, 536876815, 536876919, 536876932, 536876946, 536876976, 536876982, 536876996, 536877029, 536877053, 536877101, 536877133, 536877210, 536877230, 536877237, 536877238, 536877290, 536877295, 536877303, 536877304, 536877319, 536877376, 536877377, 536877381, 536877383, 536877394, 536877516, 536877560, 536877565, 536877575, 536877632, 536877696, 536877752, 536877755, 536877757, 536877758, 536877762, 536877763, 536877765, 536877768, 536877804, 536877882, 536877883, 536877904, 536877992, 536877993, 536878024, 536878078, 536878088, 536878100, 536878150, 536878158, 536878209, 536878263, 536878278, 536878299, 536878304, 536878324, 536878325, 536878335, 536878349, 536878396, 536878442, 536878459, 536878474, 536878475, 536878476, 536878513, 536878539, 536878546, 536878553, 536878556, 536878562, 536878604, 536879021, 536879068, 536879105, 536879189, 536879217, 536879697, 536879756, 536879812, 536879859, 536879875, 536879908, 536879980, 536880021, 536880051, 536880094, 536880186, 536880188, 536880198, 536880216, 536880230, 536880243, 536880244, 536880246, 536880248, 536880252, 536880341, 536880351, 536880355, 536880365, 536880405, 536880464, 536880545, 536880548, 536880549, 536880573, 536880654, 536880655, 536880704, 536880711, 536880744, 536880805, 536880843, 536880859, 536880918, 536880927, 536880959, 536880968, 536880988, 536880994, 536881079, 536881267, 536881452, 536881465, 536882025, 536882302, 536882365, 536882436, 536882489, 536882693, 536882699, 536882700, 536882701, 536882702, 536882703, 536882704, 536882705, 536882706, 536882707, 536882708, 536882709, 536882710, 536882712, 536882713, 536882848, 536882965, 536883249, 536883252, 536883254, 536883260, 536883287, 536883539, 536883542, 536883603, 536883666, 536883922, 536884006, 536884102, 536884205, 536885121, 536885145, 536885295, 536885296, 536887630, 536888363, 536890878, 536890879]",Null,Any[1],Null,"Any[23138, 23139, 23141, 23142, 94342]","Any[8, 9, 45]","Any[421, 426, 832, 1020, 2985, 3349, 9927, 11270, 11416]",Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4

The title was designed by Ken Levine and co-developed by Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios.

Kerrigan and other residents escape to the flagship of Raynor's Raiders, the Hyperion, but Commander Jim Raynor is cut off by the Dominion. The Hyperion escapes, but Kerrigan remains behind to locate Raynor, only to hear a Dominion newscast announcing that he has been captured and executed. Enraged, Kerrigan returns to Zerg territory to retake control of the swarm and overthrow the tyrannical Dominion. 
 
On the volcanic planet Char, Kerrigan subdues a renegade brood before attacking the occupying Dominion forces. Kerrigan, in a rage, destroys a Dominion command fortress and kills its commander, General Horace Warfield. After a change of heart, she allows the wounded and the unarmed to evacuate. On the frozen planet Kaldir, she annihilates the local Protoss forces, reclaiming the local brood and evolving the swarm to survive in harsh climate. 
 
Zeratul visits Kerrigan and advises her to regain her powers by traveling to Zerus, the original homeworld of the Zerg. On Zerus, Kerrigan learns that a fallen Xel'Naga named Amon was responsible for making the Zerg what they are: A warring swarm, bound to a single overriding will. Some primal Zerg, however, eluded and remained independent constantly evolving creatures. One such zerg named Zurvan, known as the ""Ancient One"", lies dormant in hibernation and must be awoken by Kerrigan for its knowledge on the origins of the Zerg. Upon awakening, Zurvan advises Kerrigan to seek out a primordial spawning pool to regain her former powers. Kerrigan enters the ancient spawning pool and transforms into a primal Queen of Blades. She kills and absorbs the genetic essences of four powerful hostile primal leaders and Zurvan after it attempts to collect her essence for itself. A primal leader called Dehaka and his pack join her, provided that she gives them essence to collect. 
 
Kerrigan is contacted by a Zerg-infested Alexei Stukov, a former Vice Admiral of the United Earth Directorate who was apparently killed by Duran at Braxis. With Stukov's aid, Kerrigan assaults a research station where Emil Narud, a servant of Amon, is breeding Protoss-Zerg hybrids. After eliminating Dominion facility security forces and Tal'Darim loyal to Narud, Kerrigan confronts Narud in a showdown of power. Morphing first into Raynor and then into Kerrigan's human form, Narud impales Kerrigan before being fatally wounded. Revealing that Amon is revived, he perishes. 
 
Meanwhile, Emperor Arcturus Mengsk contacts Kerrigan and claims Raynor is kept alive and imprisoned, as a bargaining chip against Kerrigan attacking the Dominion throne world of Korhal IV. Kerrigan relays the news to the Hyperion. They plan to hack the Dominion network to locate Raynor, but the only one with such expertise is Colonel Orlan, held captive by Mira Han, a mercenary who refuses to release him. Thus, the Hyperion attacks Mira's mining operations, forcing her to comply. Orlan locates Raynor on a prison ship that constantly changes location. Kerrigan assaults the ship and rescues Raynor, who is revolted by Kerrigan's reversion of form. Although he cannot bring himself to shoot Kerrigan, he tells her that they are done despite her confession that she loves him. 
 
Having united all Zerg under the swarm, Kerrigan launches an invasion of Korhal, concentrating on the capital city of Augustgrad. With the aid of Dehaka and his pack, she destroys Mengsk's Psi Destroyer, a device that hurts the swarm from afar but is ineffective on the primal Zerg. As Kerrigan sends the swarm to assault Mengsk's palace, Crown Prince Valerian urges her to slow down her invasion to minimize civilian losses; she accepts, understanding that Valerian is not like his father. Midway through the final battle, Raynor arrives to assist Kerrigan, much to her surprise. Together, they succeed in breaching the imperial palace. In the confrontation that follows, Mengsk reveals that he has the Xel'Naga artifact in his possession, intending to use it to kill Kerrigan. Before Mengsk can do so Raynor interferes, allowing Kerrigan to impale Mengsk. Kerrigan kills Mengsk by injecting psionic energy causing him to explode. 
 
As the dust settles, Kerrigan thanks Raynor before joining her swarm. With her quest for vengeance completed she renounces everything she once was or had and prepares to face Amon, the enemy of all living things, in a conflict that will not only decide the fate of the Koprulu Sector, but the entire Galaxy.","You are Sarah Kerrigan, former Queen of Blades.

In August 2004, former U.S. Navy SEAL officer and Gulf War veteran Sam Fisher is recruited by the National Security Agency to work within its newly formed division, ""Third Echelon."" Working with his old friend Irving Lambert, Fisher is introduced to technical expert Anna ""Grim"" Grimsdóttír, and field runner Vernon Wilkes Jr. 
 
In October 2004, Fisher is dispatched to Tbilisi, Georgia to investigate the disappearance of two CIA officers. Fisher attempts to meet an informant, Thomas Gurgenidze, only to find him dying in a burning building. Gurgenidze warns that one agent's transmission mentioned proof that could cause a war. Finding the agents' corpses in a police morgue, Fisher learns that a former Spetsnaz agent, Vyacheslav Grinko, removed their subdermal tracking implants. Tracking Grinko's license plate number using CCTV, Third Echelon tracks him to the Georgian Ministry of Defense. 
 
Fisher arrives at the Ministry, and records a meeting between Grinko and Canadian hacker Phillip Masse, through which he learns that Nikoladze is conducting an illegal operation in Azerbaijan. Fisher hacks Nikoladze's computer, and learns Nikoladze has been waging an ethnic cleansing campaign across Azerbaijan, by deploying Georgian commandos. In retaliation, NATO forces enter Azerbaijan, prompting Nikoladze to go underground. 
 
Third Echelon learns that Georgian soldiers stationed on a Caspian oil rig have been exchanging data with the Georgian Presidential Palace. Fisher infiltrates the rig during the middle of a NATO airstrike to apprehend a local technician, Lejava, and retrieve his laptop containing the rig's computer data. After interrogating the technician, Fisher learns that the data contains a file on ""The Ark"", Fisher recovers his laptop and encryption key and extracts. 
 
Examining Lejava's laptop, Grim reveals that the intel could have come from a CIA mole. Lambert then reveals that North America has just been hit by a massive cyber warfare attack, directed primarily against military targets. In a broadcast, Nikoladze claims responsibility for the attack and officially declares war on the United States and its allies. Fisher infiltrates the CIA headquarters and accesses the CIA computer mainframe, allowing Grim to trace the data leak to the computer of Mitchell Dougherty. Captured for interrogation, Dougherty claims ignorance of the leak, but the NSA learns that his obsessive–compulsive disorder caused him to back up data on an insecure laptop, which was exploited by a network owned by Kalinatek, Inc. 
 
Georgia-hired mafiosos attempt to remove all traces of Nikoladze from the Kalinatek offices by destroying the building and murdering the staff. Intercepting a 911 call from a technician named Ivan, Fisher is deployed to the building and retrieves Ivan's encryption key while the FBI rescues Ivan. Fisher extracts with the help of Wilkes, who is mortally wounded in the process and later dies. Using the encryption key, the NSA discovers Nikoladze has been using a network of unconventional relays to communicate with Georgian military cells. The NSA traces the full relay network to the Chinese Embassy in Yangon, Myanmar. Worried Chinese support could cause World War III, Fisher sneaks into the embassy and eavesdrops on a conversation between Nikoladze and General Kong Feirong, and learns they are working together. 
 
Fisher learns that captured U.S. Army soldiers and high-ranking Chinese officials are in a local slaughterhouse, so he delays interrogating Feirong to save the hostages, who are scheduled to be executed on a live broadcast. Fisher meets with a Chinese official among the hostages, and learns that Feirong is part of a rogue collective not backed by the Chinese government. Fisher is detected, and in a firefight, Fisher kills Grinko. Returning to the embassy, Fisher grabs a drunken Feirong before he can commit suicide, and forces him to share the information stored on his computer; the information reveals Nikoladze has fled back to Georgia, where he is trying to activate a suitcase nuke known as ""The Ark"". 
 
Infiltrating the Georgian Presidential Palace containing Nikoladze and new de facto Georgian president Varlam Cristavi, Fisher attempts to recover the key to the Ark, which has been placed somewhere in the United States. Fisher corners Nikoladze, who bargains to give the Ark key in exchange for safe passage out of Georgia; before Fisher can recover it, Cristavi soldiers take Nikoladze and the Ark key elsewhere. About to be executed, Fisher escapes when Lambert causes a brief blackout. Discovering Nikoladze is offering the Ark's location for protection, Fisher assassinates Nikoladze. Discovering the Ark, the U.S. Army evacuates an apartment complex in Hope Gate, Maryland on claims of a gas leak, and secretly recovers the Ark. 
 
Despite World War III being averted, Nikoladze's corpse sparks international backlash due to the suspicious circumstances around his death. Watching the Presidential broadcast on the crisis, Fisher then receives a secure phone call from Lambert for another assignment.

This legion and its allies are the main enemy which players will fight against in The Burning Crusade. In addition to some new areas on Azeroth, this expansion mainly features the ravaged world of Outland which the Burning Legion and other powerful beings control. 
 
The Doom Lord Kazzak reopened the Dark Portal to Outland, flooding Azeroth with the ravenous demons of the Burning Legion. Expeditions from the Horde and Alliance, reinforced by their new blood elf and draenei allies, passed through the gateway to stop the invasion at its source. On Outland's desiccated Hellfire Peninsula, the Alliance discovered several of their heroes who had crossed through the portal many years before, while the Horde made contact with the Mag'har—'uncorrupted' orcs who had not participated in their race's original invasion of Azeroth. The expedition into Outland dragged Horde and Alliance armies further into conflict with the agents of the Legion and the lieutenants of Illidan Stormrage, who had claimed the shattered realm for his own.","World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade, the first expansion for World of Warcraft.

""Demon's Souls is set in a fictional dark fantasy world, taking part mostly in the southern medieval kingdom of Boletaria, that has been consumed by a thick, mysterious Fog that is creeping ever out to blanket the entire world. The Old One, a colossal immortal flying Demon, has been awoken and with it Demons have come forth to consume the souls of men. Only when The Old One is lulled back to eternal slumber will the fog dissipate and the world be restored.""","Set in a dark fantasy world, players take control of a hero who has journeyed to the fictional kingdom of Boletaria, which is being ravaged by a cursed fog that brings forth demons who feast on the souls of mortals. The game has been described as a spiritual successor to the King's Field series of games.

Inside, he meets Dracula's servant Death (Dennis Falt; Travis Willingham in the redub), who warns him to stop his quest to destroy the castle and strips him of his equipment. He also meets Maria Renard (Kimberly Forsythe; Michelle Ruff in the redub), a seventeen-year-old vampire hunter who fought alongside Richter and is now searching for him, and the castle's librarian, who sells items and equipment to Alucard. Periodically encountering Maria throughout the castle, Alucard also meets Richter, who claims to be the new lord of the castle and forces him to battle with two monsters. 
 
Alucard defeats the monsters, finds Maria again, and tells her about Richter. Upset, she leaves Alucard to confirm it for herself. Convinced that Richter is under somebody else's control, Maria meets Alucard again; she urges him not to hurt Richter and gives him an item that allows him to see past illusions. In the castle's keep, Alucard confronts Richter and learns that he plans to resurrect Dracula so he may battle the vampire for eternity. Alucard breaks the spell controlling Richter. Dracula's servant Shaft (Jeff Manning; Tony Oliver in the redub) appears and reveals that despite the spell being broken, Dracula will be resurrected soon. Shaft summons an inverted version of the castle. 
 
Alucard leaves Richter to Maria's care and enters the inverted castle to find and destroy Shaft. Along the way, he defeats Death and eventually finds Shaft. Shaft admits he planned to end the threat of the Belmont clan by controlling one as the master of the castle and forcing them to fight each other. Alucard defeats Shaft, who reveals that Dracula's resurrection is complete. Alucard faces his own father, who vows to destroy humankind because Alucard's mother Lisa was executed as a witch. Alucard refuses to join his father in his revenge and the two battle. Alucard defeats his father and suggests he lost the battle because he lost his ability to love after Lisa's death. Dracula quotes the biblical verse Matthew 16:26 (in the dub) and learns that Lisa's final words were of eternal love for him and a plea not to hate – or at least harm – humanity. 
 
As Dracula vanishes, he asks for Lisa's forgiveness and bids his son farewell. Escaping the crumbling castle, Alucard rejoins Maria and Richter. Maria expresses relief that he escaped while Richter blames himself as the reason for Alucard's fight with his father. Alucard tells Richter, ""the only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing,"" (an attributed quote from Edmund Burke) and resolves to disappear from the world because of his cursed bloodline. Depending on how much of the castle the player has explored, Maria either chases Alucard in the hope of changing his mind, or resigns herself to Alucard's fate and leaves with Richter.","Dracula's castle has risen again and it's up to the mysterious Alucard to face Dracula and save the world from his nocturnal embrace.

As the first remakes in the Pokémon franchise, the games revisit the original pair of Pokémon games, Pokémon Red and Green Versions, and so feature all of the characters, plot elements, and challenges of them, but with several important upgrades to bring them up to speed with other Generation III games.
The Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter was initially included with the games when they were first released, eliminating the need for Game Link Cables when trading between the two games (and later Pokémon Emerald Version). In later copies, it was sold separately.
FireRed and LeafGreen went on to become the second best-selling games of the Game Boy Advance, only behind Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire Versions.

The game is set in the Chernobyl exclusion zone which turned from a destiny-breaker place into a threat to all mankind. The Zone is reluctant to open up its mysteries and needs to be forced to do it. It is a rare hero who can reach the very heart of the Zone onto find out what danger awaits him there. 
 
A danger which, compared to marauders and enemy groupings, all monsters and anomalies, will seem a mere preparation to the meeting with something more fatal and threatening. 
 
But for now… get ready, hero. Collect artefacts and trade, grope your path and keep an eye on the rear, catch roentgens and fight – only make sure you survive! And then, perhaps, if you are persistent and truly lucky, you will find out why all this had fallen on you.","Any[1, 18, 19, 21, 33, 268435461, 536870913, 536870981, 536871033, 536871041, 536871044, 536871120, 536871133, 536871213, 536871332, 536871365, 536871470, 536871882, 536871938, 536872032, 536872070, 536872225, 536872229, 536872234, 536872352, 536872371, 536872748, 536872793, 536873111, 536873362, 536873364, 536874745, 536874843, 536875046, 536875059, 536875067, 536875095, 536875151, 536875171, 536875242, 536875243, 536875249, 536875264, 536875309, 536875320, 536875324, 536875356, 536875358, 536875436, 536875453, 536875483, 536875491, 536875492, 536875494, 536875497, 536875531, 536875572, 536875574, 536875624, 536875682, 536875728, 536875741, 536875743, 536875808, 536875812, 536875819, 536875822, 536875870, 536875902, 536876071, 536876221, 536876262, 536876364, 536876365, 536876379, 536876440, 536876441, 536876454, 536876550, 536876563, 536876575, 536876660, 536876695, 536876712, 536876726, 536876748, 536876812, 536876933, 536876974, 536877144, 536877162, 536877217, 536877263, 536877264, 536877286, 536877302, 536877371, 536877400, 536877453, 536877493, 536877519, 536877537, 536877605, 536877741, 536877892, 536877950, 536877955, 536877965, 536878011, 536878104, 536878317, 536878421, 536878425, 536878574, 536878582, 536879054, 536879678, 536879731, 536879837, 536879881, 536879888, 536879915, 536879934, 536879958, 536879984, 536880294, 536880449, 536880610, 536880613, 536880614, 536880615, 536880725, 536880786, 536880817, 536880818, 536880873, 536880959, 536881017, 536881123, 536881151, 536881277, 536881282, 536881290, 536881295, 536881431, 536882134, 536882257, 536882324, 536882330, 536882341, 536882362, 536882381, 536882385, 536882885, 536882911, 536882934, 536883035, 536883206, 536883259, 536883614, 536883884, 536883887, 536884022, 536884026, 536884061, 536884107, 536884231, 536884232, 536884233, 536884235, 536884236, 536884237, 536884238, 536884239, 536884240, 536884241, 536884242, 536884507]",Any[74],"Any[1, 2]",Null,"Any[1124, 1125, 1126, 62054, 62055]",Any[6],"Any[41, 241, 316, 495, 564, 571, 4840, 7605, 8744]",S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl

After contact with Bravo Team is lost, Alpha Team is sent to investigate their disappearance. Alpha Team locates Bravo Team's crashed helicopter and land at the site, where they are suddenly attacked by a pack of monstrous dogs, killing one of the team's members. After Alpha Team's helicopter pilot, Brad Vickers, panics and takes off alone, the remaining members of the team (Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker and Barry Burton) are forced to seek refuge in a nearby abandoned mansion. 
 
Depending on which character the player assumes control of, either Chris or Barry are separated from the rest of the team during the chase and do not make it to the mansion. At this point, the team decides to split up to investigate. Over the course of the game, the player character may encounter several members of Bravo Team, including Enrico Marini, the captain of the S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team, who reveals that one of Alpha Team's members is a traitor before being shot and killed by an unseen assailant. The player character eventually learns that a series of illegal experiments were being undertaken by a clandestine research team under the authority and supervision of biomedical company Umbrella Corporation. The creatures roaming the mansion and its surrounding areas are the results of these experiments, which have exposed the mansion's personnel and various animals and insects to a highly contagious and mutagenic biological agent known as the T-virus. 
 
Eventually, the player character discovers a secret underground laboratory containing Umbrella's experiments. In the lab, the player encounters Wesker, who reveals that he is a double agent working for Umbrella, and plans to use the Tyrant, a giant humanoid supersoldier, to kill the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members. However, in the ensuing confrontation, Wesker is supposedly killed and the player character defeats the Tyrant. After activating the lab's self-destruct system, the player character reaches the heliport and manages to contact Brad for extraction, at which point the player may be confronted by Tyrant one last time. The game features multiple endings depending on the player's actions at key points over the course of the game.

Dante arrives, and murders The Order's leader, the High Priest Sanctus, in front of the entire congregation. At the same time, an army of demons invade the city, putting everyone, including Nero's love interest Kyrie, in danger. Tasked with stopping Dante by Kyrie's brother Credo, the Captain of the Holy Knights, Nero's journey leads him to discover that he is in fact a descendant of Sparda himself, and Dante is not his enemy. Under orders from Sanctus, Agnus, has been siphoning the power of the long lost Devil Arm Yamato, the sword of Dante's brother Vergil, to create a demonic army, and imbue high-ranking members of the Order with demonic power. To Agnus' shock, the shattered Yamato restores itself in Nero's presence, and flies to Nero's aid. With The Order's plans revealed, Agnus flees to inform the newly resurrected Sanctus. 
 
As Nero sets his sights on The Order, he discovers to his dismay that Credo is part of the conspiracy, until he ends up being deceived as well when they witness Kyrie being kidnapped by a newly revived Sanctus. He intends to use a creature known as Savior to defeat the demon army he's created, as a means of strengthening the people's worship of Sparda. With the Sparda Sword already in his possession, and needing the blood of a descendant of Sparda along with the Yamato, Sanctus captures Nero to power The Savior's core. Dante arrives, with Trish, who was revealed to be a spy within The Order, and makes a promise to the dying Credo to save Nero and Kyrie. Splitting up, Trish evacuates Fortuna's human residents, while Dante destroys all the Hell Gates scattered over Fortuna, and defeats Agnus, reclaiming the Yamato sword for the last time. Confronting the Savior in a sky battle above Fortuna, Dante drives the Yamato through The Savior's chest, where Nero recovers it inside, freeing himself and Kyrie, and defeating Sanctus. 
 
Nero is able to make peace with the power it has given him to protect those he cares about. Before Dante leaves, he decides to entrust Nero with the Yamato, and Kyrie and Nero share their first kiss in the ruins of Fortuna. Back at Dante's office, Lady arrives.

Harry took Heather into his care to raise as his own daughter. One fine day, Heather goes shopping but is suddenly thrust into a strange alternate reality filled with demonic imagery and twisted monsters. She hears footsteps, disgusting, creepy monsters attack her, and she has to defend herself. Heather quickly comes to find that the events unfolding around her have something to do with her past. Exploring the eerie town of Silent Hill, she must find a way to escape.","Silent Hill 3 is the third installment in the Silent Hill survival horror series and a direct sequel to the first game, although this is kept secret from the player for plot twist purposes. Like the previous entries, Silent Hill 3 is a survival horror combining action-based combat and puzzle-solving, but is somewhat more combat-oriented than the preceding installments. The main character is able to side-step and block some attacks, but in general shares with the other protagonists of the series their relative ineptitude in combat.","Any[1, 18, 19, 21, 268435465, 268435487, 536870928, 536870984, 536871041, 536871044, 536871071, 536871088, 536871109, 536871115, 536871127, 536871133, 536871251, 536871470, 536871878, 536871882, 536871939, 536871945, 536872014, 536872032, 536872105, 536872201, 536872225, 536872435, 536872587, 536872647, 536872715, 536872746, 536872748, 536872983, 536873154, 536873327, 536873362, 536873591, 536873787, 536873904, 536873947, 536873973, 536874115, 536874182, 536874398, 536874745, 536874872, 536874873, 536875050, 536875057, 536875058, 536875074, 536875097, 536875157, 536875158, 536875178, 536875216, 536875228, 536875229, 536875245, 536875249, 536875271, 536875275, 536875330, 536875358, 536875372, 536875390, 536875400, 536875426, 536875437, 536875453, 536875483, 536875495, 536875502, 536875503, 536875512, 536875523, 536875524, 536875525, 536875528, 536875535, 536875538, 536875542, 536875572, 536875574, 536875621, 536875623, 536875624, 536875639, 536875692, 536875731, 536875760, 536875767, 536875792, 536875800, 536875803, 536875808, 536875819, 536875830, 536875833, 536875837, 536875847, 536875870, 536875871, 536875893, 536875904, 536875934, 536875941, 536875944, 536876014, 536876086, 536876087, 536876125, 536876168, 536876176, 536876179, 536876199, 536876221, 536876287, 536876322, 536876327, 536876338, 536876348, 536876349, 536876445, 536876499, 536876511, 536876538, 536876615, 536876631, 536876646, 536876647, 536876650, 536876850, 536876875, 536876878, 536876910, 536876911, 536876982, 536876984, 536877014, 536877037, 536877049, 536877173, 536877237, 536877238, 536877264, 536877303, 536877324, 536877394, 536877407, 536877452, 536877494, 536877536, 536877560, 536877592, 536877741, 536877853, 536877967, 536877986, 536878005, 536878008, 536878085, 536878096, 536878097, 536878193, 536878209, 536878255, 536878317, 536878400, 536879093, 536879187, 536879207, 536879859, 536879895, 536880285, 536880357, 536880654, 536880655, 536880845, 536880865, 536880888, 536881061, 536881087, 536881102, 536881248, 536881449, 536881528, 536882493, 536882765, 536882898, 536883035, 536883681, 536884023, 536884027, 536884029, 536884411, 536884412, 536884413, 536884414, 536884840, 536886096, 536886097, 536886885, 536886918, 536886919, 536886920, 536886921, 536886922, 536886923, 536887629]",Null,Any[1],Null,"Any[3589, 99387]","Any[6, 8]","Any[37, 41, 480, 481, 1009, 2031, 3188, 9727, 11270]",Silent Hill 3

Mike Powell, the protagonist, is a skilled U.S. Army Ranger and later an agent of the Office of Strategic Services. Powell and a squad of Rangers are in Arzew, Algeria, fighting on the North African front. The squad fight their way into the city, but an ambush kills all the team except Powell. Powell continues into a North African Axis base, where he rescues S.A.S. agent Major Grillo and retrieves his equipment. The major and Lieutenant Powell split up, with Grillo securing transport, while Powell does sabotage in a motor pool. He then links back up with Grillo, who has commandeered a jeep with a mounted machinegun. The two then drive to a German airfield, where they successfully destroy the Stuka dive bombers grounded there. While Grillo distracts the German forces, Powell sneaks into a bunker, cuts off Axis radio contact and fights his way to a coastal lighthouse to signal the Allied fleet to begin the invasion of Africa. He escapes with Grillo then in the jeep.  
  
Following the Allies' success in Africa, Powell and Grillo are sent to German-occupied Norway to infiltrate the city of Trondheim, where a Kriegsmarine U-Boat is being outfitted with a prototype Naxos radar detector. Grillo makes it into the base first, but is killed by German guards while opening the front gate for Powell. Powell fights his way into the base, then he disguises himself as a German soldier and infiltrates the loading dock. He first goes to the lab where he destroys the Naxos prototype. Next, Powell gains access to a submarine intended to be fitted with the prototype and blows it up, then escapes into the air ducts. He then fights his way out of the base, where he is extracted by an Allied squad.  
  
Thanks to Powell's efforts, the German U-Boat threat is neutralized, clearing the way for the Allied invasion of Europe. Powell is sent to Omaha Beach under Capt. Ramsay, where he and his fellow Rangers storm the bunkers, despite taking heavy casualties, and secure the beach. He is then sent into the countryside beyond the beaches to assist various American units who are being harassed by Nebelwerfers.  
  
Powell is then assigned to go behind enemy lines and acquire intelligence on German troop movements. After rescuing a stranded British pilot Joe Baylor, Powell meets up with French Resistance member Manon Batiste (the protagonist of Medal of Honor: Underground). She sends him out to conduct various acts of sabotage against the German war effort. He then raids a manor house being used as a command post where he secures important enemy documents, including the blueprints for the new King Tiger tank. Powell then escapes the manor house with Manon's aid.  
  
Powell's next mission involves hijacking a King Tiger tank and using it to secure a vital bridge at the city of Brest. After navigating through the sniper-infested ruins, he meets up with the American tank crew chosen for the mission. Powell and the tank crew capture the King Tiger and use it to fight their way through the countryside. Upon reaching Brest, Powell provides cover for the King Tiger to protect the bridge, until reinforcements come to secure it.  
  
Powell's final mission sends him to Fort Schmerzen, a German mustard gas-producing facility that was previously raided by Lieutenant James Patterson, but has since been restored to operation, supposedly as a POW camp, but is possibly being used to produce mustard gas. Powell is parachuted into the woods, where he destroys some Flak 88s harassing Allied planes. He then infiltrates a weapons depot, and destroys a stockpile of StG 44 assault rifle and then destroys a German communications outpost, cutting off Fort Schmerzen's communications. Powell then hijacks a freight train and along with a squad of US Rangers, uses it to reach Schmerzen. Upon arriving at Schmerzen, Powell and his fellow Rangers storm the fort and release all the POWs. Powell then fights his way into the lower levels of Schmerzen, where he discovers that the fort's mustard gas production facilities are still operational.

Each district has an elevated train system and a separate power grid. The premise of the game is built around the partial destruction of the Historic District by a mysterious explosion, followed by a viral epidemic that forces federal authorities to seal the only bridge leading to the mainland. A rise in violent crime overwhelms the police, resulting in societal collapse. 
 
Characters 
The protagonist is Cole MacGrath (Jason Cottle), a courier who is accused of triggering the explosion, which leaves him with the ability to absorb and project electricity. His closest friend, Zeke Jedediah Dunbar (Caleb Moody), allows Cole to hide on his rooftop, despite his envy of the former's powers. Trish Dailey (October Moore), Cole's girlfriend, abandons him out of anger over the death of her sister Amy, while most of Empire City's residents view him as a terrorist. While attempting to escape the city with Zeke, Cole is contacted by FBI agent Moya Jones (Kimberli Colbourne), who offers to clear his name if he helps her find her husband, fellow agent John White (Phil LaMarr). White vanished while investigating a group known as the First Sons, who are believed to be responsible for orchestrating the explosion. 
 
While working to restore order in the Neon District, Cole encounters Sasha (Jessica Straus), a former member of the First Sons, who like Cole is a ""Conduit"", an individual given powers by the First Sons. Using her ability to control the minds of others via a tar-like substance, she has formed a gang known as the Reapers. Meanwhile, the Warren has been overrun by the Dust Men, an army of homeless militants led by Alden Tate (also Jason Cottle), the original leader of the First Sons, who possesses telekinesis. Kessler (Sam A. Mowry), the true antagonist of the game, is a shadowy figure who controls the First Sons and who takes an obsessive interest in Cole and his powers. 
 
Story 
While the basic story of InFamous remains unchanged whether the player opts for the ""Good"" or ""Evil"" karma path, there are some story elements that change depending on Cole's choices. 
 
While making a delivery in the Historic District, Cole is instructed to open the package. In doing so, he activates a device known as the Ray Sphere, leveling six city blocks and nearly killing him. Rescued by Zeke and Trish, he teaches himself to control his emerging powers. After using them in public to fight off a Reaper attack, the locals turn against Cole after he is accused of triggering the explosion, forcing him into hiding. He and Zeke engineer an assault on the sealed bridge, only to be ambushed by government forces. Separated from his friend, Cole meets Moya, who persuades him to return and find John. With her help, Cole restores the district's power supply, earning the attention of Sasha, who lures him into her underground lair. Cole defeats her, but she is abducted by the Sons before he can make her talk. Trapped in the Warren, Cole assists what remains of the police in battling the Dust Men. Alden is arrested and imprisoned, but Zeke's incompetence in guarding him allows the Dust Men to free him and massacre most of the officers. With Alden planning to reactivate the Sphere, the two patch things up and confront him, with Zeke ending up in possession of the Sphere. Giving in to his temptations, Zeke deserts Cole and takes the Sphere to Kessler. 
 
With Alden on a murderous rampage towards the Historic District, Cole defeats him once and for all in a bridge battle. Before jumping in the water, Alden reveals that Kessler exiled him from the First Sons. White, who turns out to be an NSA agent with no connection to Moya, reaches out to Cole and explains that the Ray Sphere is designed to consume bio-energy from thousands of lives and transfer it to a single user, making them a Conduit. During their search for the Sphere, Kessler publicly challenges Cole to stop a series of bombings across the district, ending with him being forced to choose between saving Trish or her colleagues. Regardless of which choice he makes, Cole fails to keep Trish from dying. Determined to punish Kessler, Cole tracks the Sphere to a remote pier, where he must decide whether to destroy it or use it to become even more powerful. Regardless, the Sphere releases the last of its energy, killing John before disappearing into a vortex.","inFAMOUS is a 3rd person action adventure open world title in which the main character Cole MacGrat ends up with electricity-based super powers after being caught in an explosion. 
 
The player follows the story through a heavily influenced comic book approach, and can decide to play towards a good or evil paths with Cole's powers. These choices ultimately affect character growth, the reaction of the City's populace towards Cole, and finer elements of gameplay and the story.","Any[1, 33, 38, 268435461, 268435464, 268435465, 268435468, 536870926, 536871382, 536872371]",Null,Any[1],Null,"Any[1272, 1273]",Any[9],"Any[18225, 19164, 26574, 81249, 90099, 105049, 105269, 113114, 116681]",inFAMOUS

His squad discuss their deployment, somewhat irritated that they have not been told what they are being deployed for. However, as they are nearing their Landing Zone at Black Mesa, airborne alien creatures attack the Osprey formation, causing Shephard's Osprey to crash land. Shephard regains consciousness in a Black Mesa medical bay, tended to by the science team, learning that the Marines are being steadily beaten by the alien forces from Xen and orders have come through to pull out. Consequently, Shephard departs to reach an extraction point and escape the facility. However, Shephard is prevented from reaching the extraction point by the enigmatic G-Man, forcing the evacuation craft to leave without him. 
 
Other Marines who have also been left behind team up with Shephard and attempt to reach another extraction point near Black Mesa's Lambda Complex, but en route they come under attack from black operations units seeking to thoroughly contain the situation and eliminate all survivors. Shephard makes it to the Lambda Complex alive, and briefly sees Gordon Freeman as the latter teleports to Xen in the final stages of Half-Life. To escape the teleportation chamber, Shephard is forced to enter a separate portal, briefly taking him to Xen before depositing him in an entirely different area of the facility. The facility is now heavily damaged, and it soon becomes clear that a new alien race, Race X, has exploited the situation to mount a localized invasion, attacking both human and Xen forces in Black Mesa indiscriminately. Fighting between the black operations units and Race X quickly intensifies. 
 
Shephard soon encounters more stranded Marine units in the wreckage of the base, and tries to break through the black operations units to reach an escape point past the facility's storage unit, but meets heavy resistance from both Race X and the black operations units. A surviving Black Mesa security guard reveals to Shephard that the black operators intend to detonate a tactical nuclear weapon in the base, thereby totally sealing it off and killing everything in it. After successfully neutralizing the guarding black operations unit, Shephard disarms the device and proceeds to the nearby storage areas, intent on escape. However, the G-Man rearms the device as Shephard departs. The storage unit has become a thick battleground between Race X and the black operation units, and although Shephard manages to evade them, he is informed by another security guard that something very large is coming through an alien portal blocking the exit path. 
 
At the portal, Shephard discovers a gene worm, a massive creature facilitating the Race X invasion. Shephard is able to kill the creature, but just afterwards he is teleported onto an Osprey by the G-Man. As the G-Man congratulates Shephard on his accomplishments, the nuclear device detonates in the background, destroying Black Mesa. The game closes with the G-Man detaining Shephard someplace where he can tell no one of what he has seen and cannot be harmed, pending further evaluation.","Opposing Force returns to the same setting as Half-Life, but instead portrays the events from the perspective of a U.S. Marine, one of the enemy characters in the original game. The player character, Adrian Shephard, is sent in to neutralize the Black Mesa Research Facility after a scientific mishap causes it to be invaded by aliens, but quickly finds that the Marines are outnumbered and slowly being beaten back by a second alien race and black operations units.","Any[1, 18, 20, 39, 268435461, 268435464, 268435465, 536870913, 536870915, 536870933, 536871041, 536871049, 536871213, 536871243, 536871365, 536871378, 536871470, 536871474, 536871475, 536871506, 536871701, 536871882, 536871937, 536872010, 536872070, 536872245, 536872257, 536872352, 536872449, 536872810, 536872862, 536872898, 536873027, 536873111, 536873192, 536873874, 536873973, 536873999, 536874115, 536874743, 536874947, 536875046, 536875058, 536875073, 536875095, 536875097, 536875151, 536875158, 536875171, 536875199, 536875229, 536875242, 536875249, 536875265, 536875271, 536875305, 536875325, 536875330, 536875358, 536875372, 536875420, 536875453, 536875464, 536875483, 536875484, 536875488, 536875491, 536875492, 536875501, 536875510, 536875524, 536875525, 536875527, 536875532, 536875537, 536875538, 536875545, 536875547, 536875549, 536875572, 536875574, 536875625, 536875642, 536875649, 536875650, 536875675, 536875745, 536875787, 536875792, 536875804, 536875808, 536875815, 536875818, 536875819, 536875822, 536875832, 536875837, 536875868, 536875907, 536875934, 536875941, 536876008, 536876028, 536876068, 536876093, 536876094, 536876097, 536876108, 536876172, 536876176, 536876221, 536876261, 536876262, 536876348, 536876356, 536876377, 536876406, 536876423, 536876454, 536876466, 536876502, 536876619, 536876645, 536876654, 536876665, 536876685, 536876687, 536876702, 536876798, 536876816, 536876832, 536876850, 536876913, 536876922, 536876996, 536877025, 536877128, 536877159, 536877212, 536877220, 536877227, 536877229, 536877239, 536877264, 536877283, 536877407, 536877443, 536877501, 536877532, 536877533, 536877537, 536877567, 536877603, 536877643, 536877647, 536877654, 536877658, 536877672, 536877724, 536877905, 536877952, 536877960, 536877961, 536877966, 536877974, 536877976, 536878002, 536878004, 536878028, 536878032, 536878132, 536878147, 536878261, 536878280, 536878317, 536878322, 536878346, 536878419, 536878518, 536878579, 536879053, 536879187, 536879584, 536879678, 536879700, 536879706, 536879707, 536879731, 536879786, 536879808, 536879830, 536879870, 536879871, 536879951, 536880066, 536880090, 536880117, 536880208, 536880225, 536880341, 536880345, 536880510, 536880633, 536880709, 536880725, 536880732, 536880761, 536880786, 536880892, 536880893, 536880894, 536880896, 536880897, 536880901, 536880903, 536881275, 536881289, 536881419, 536881457, 536881514, 536881535, 536881647, 536881995, 536882257, 536882443, 536883035, 536883107, 536883881, 536883944, 536884026, 536885281, 536885424, 536886212, 536886391, 536886392, 536886393, 536886394, 536886395]",Any[4],"Any[1, 2]",Null,"Any[639, 18906, 18907]","Any[3, 6, 14]","Any[231, 241, 247, 338, 356, 564, 571, 2031, 7351]",Half-Life: Opposing Force

It is the sequel to the 1987 game Maniac Mansion. The game's plot follows Bernard Bernoulli and his friends Hoagie and Laverne as they attempt to stop the evil Purple Tentacle — a sentient, disembodied tentacle — from taking over the world. The player takes control of the three and solves puzzles while using time travel to explore different periods of history. 
 
Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer co-led the game's development, their first time in such a role. The pair carried over a limited amount of elements from Maniac Mansion and forwent the character selection aspect to simplify development. Inspirations included Chuck Jones cartoons and the history of the United States. Day of the Tentacle is the eighth LucasArts title to use the SCUMM engine, and the company's first title to feature voice acting. 
 
The game was released simultaneously on floppy disk and CD-ROM to critical acclaim and commercial success. Critics focused on its cartoon-style visuals and comedic elements.

A tremor topples the coffin and Ico escapes. As he searches the castle, he comes across Yorda (ヨルダ Yoruda?), a captive girl who speaks a different language. Ico helps Yorda escape and defends her from shadow-like creatures. The pair make their way through the castle and arrive at the bridge leading to land. As they cross, the Queen, ruler of the castle, appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle. The Queen destroys part of the bridge; although Yorda tries to save him, Ico falls off the bridge and loses consciousness.

Ico awakens below the castle and makes his way back to the upper levels, finding a magic sword that dispels the shadow creatures. After discovering that Yorda has been turned to stone by the Queen. He confronts the Queen in her throne room, who reveals that she plans to restart her life anew by taking possession of Yorda's body. Ico slays the Queen with the magic sword, but with her death the castle begins to collapse around him; he is hit by falling debris, breaking his horns, and he falls unconscious. The Queen's spell on Yorda is broken, and a shadowy Yorda carries Ico safely out of the castle to a boat, sending him to drift to the shore alone. Ico awakens to find the distant castle in ruins, and Yorda, in her human form, washed up nearby. She stirs.","Ico (イコ Iko?, /ˈiːkoʊ/) is an action-adventure game developed by Team Ico and published by Sony Computer Entertainment, released for the PlayStation 2 video game console in 2001 and 2002 across various regions. It was designed and directed by Fumito Ueda, who wanted to create a minimalist game around a ""boy meets girl"" concept. Originally planned for the PlayStation, Ico took approximately four years to develop. The team employed a ""subtracting design"" approach to reduce elements of gameplay that interfered with the game's setting and story in order to create a high level of immersion.

The protagonist is a young boy named Ico who was born with horns, which his village considers a bad omen. Warriors lock him away in an abandoned fortress. During his explorations of the fortress, Ico encounters Yorda, the daughter of the castle's Queen. The Queen plans to use Yorda's body to extend her own lifespan. Learning this, Ico seeks to escape the castle with Yorda, keeping her safe from the shadow-like creatures that attempt to draw her back. Throughout the game, the player controls Ico as he explores the castle, solves puzzles and assists Yorda across obstacles.

Ico introduced several design and technical elements, including a story told with minimal dialog, bloom lighting and key frame animation, that have influenced subsequent games. Although not a commercial success, it was critically acclaimed for its art and story elements and received several awards, including ""Game of the Year"" nominations and three Game Developers Choice Awards. Ico is listed on several overall top game lists, and is often considered a work of art. The game was reprinted in Europe in 2006, in conjunction with the release of Shadow of the Colossus, the spiritual successor to Ico.

Those that don't drown will reach the forsaken shores of Wraeclast, where the only welcome is the clinging embrace of undeath. However, a small band of survivors has managed to hold fast in a ruined lighthouse, desperately repelling both the grasping undead and the manic scavengers that stubbornly cling to their last shreds of humanity. Under the commanding gaze of Axiom Prison, snarling goatmen roam the craggy bluffs, always keeping their cloven feet well clear of the rhoa-infested swamps in the lowlands. All along the coast, rotting shipwrecks litter the shoreline, the spirits of the stranded sailors still haunting the wreckages of their ill-fated ships, waiting to take out their sorrow and rage on those who yet live. All the while, the Siren herself continues her sweet, sad song, luring ever more ships to their watery graves. 
 
Farther inland, through the twisting caves and darkened forests, the ruins of civilisation become more apparent. The ravages of time have worn many buildings to rubble, and stripped away decaying flesh, leaving only grotesquely grinning bones. The dark, fetid caves and underground passages are a clattering refuge for these skeletal ranks, while the open forests and riverways brim with monstrous beasts with a taste for blood. Recently, ragtag groups of bloodthirsty bandits have built fortified camps in the forest, openly challenging one another while extorting food and supplies from the small, struggling village that sits between them atop a stone dam. Ignored by the squabbling bandits, strange newcomers clad in black armor have been seen skulking around various large ruins, their purpose both mysterious yet unsettling. 
 
Atop a sheer cliff of ruptured mantle, straddling the river feeding a mighty waterfall, lies the fallen capital of the Eternal Empire. Its former glory rots amid the ruins of a blasted cityscape, the buildings decrepit and mouldering. But Sarn is far from uninhabited. Many of the original citizens still lurk the dark recesses, their humanity washed clean by the cataclysm of centuries past. These Undying monsters roam the city at night and skulk the shadows during the day, for the naked sunlight is anathema to their shrivelled, leathery skin. The sun-scarred days are far from peaceful, however. A legion of soldiers from Oriath has occupied the area to the west of the river, and is fighting an all-out war against the multifarious denizens of the city. Every day their black-clad soldiers battle twisted insects that scuttle and breed, feasting on anything that moves. Every day they throw battalions against the army of floating, red Ribbons that eviscerate all who trespass on their domain. Every day they skirmish against a small group of exiles who have barricaded themselves on a small island in the middle of the river, caught between certain death on both sides.","Wraeclast: the land of the damned. This forsaken continent is home to many writhing horrors, murderous beasts, and ravenous undead. The very soil is permeated with dark, ancient power, the earth shivering with malice. The dead are refused peace, rising up and hopelessly wandering in eternal pain, sorrow and hunger. The wildlife is twisted and misshapen, unnaturally aggressive and savage. Lurking in the darkest of corners, unspeakable horrors lie in wait for unsuspecting prey, eager to rip apart the mind as well as the flesh.

Street Fighter II is credited for starting the fighting game boom during the 1990s. Its success led to the production of several updated versions, each offering additional features and characters over previous versions, as well as many home versions. Some of the home versions of the Street Fighter II games have sold millions of copies, with the SNES port of the first Street Fighter II being Capcom's best-selling consumer game of all-time as of 2008. 
 
Street Fighter II follows several of the conventions and rules already established by its original 1987 predecessor. The player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent's vitality before the timer runs out. If both opponents knock each other out at the same time or the timer runs out with both fighters having an equal amount of vitality left, a ""double KO"" or ""draw game"" is declared and additional rounds will be played until sudden death. In the first Street Fighter II, a match could last up to ten rounds if there was no clear winner; this was reduced to four rounds in Champion Edition and onward. If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round, then either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a 2-player match. 
 
After every third match in the single player mode, the player will participate in a ""bonus game"" for additional points. The bonus games includes (in order) a car-breaking event; a barrel breaking bonus game where the barrels are dropped off from a conveyor belt above the player; and a drum-breaking bonus game where drums are flammable and piled over each other. The bonus games were removed from the arcade version of Super Street Fighter II Turbo. 
 
Like in the original, the game's controls uses a configuration of an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons. The player uses the joystick to jump, crouch and move the character towards or away from the opponent, as well as to guard the character from an opponent's attacks. There are three punch buttons and three kick buttons of differing strength and speed (Light, Medium and Heavy). The player can perform a variety of basic moves in any position, including grabbing/throwing attacks, which were not featured in the original Street Fighter. Like in the original, the player can perform special moves by inputting a combination of directional and button-based commands. 
 
Street Fighter II differs from the original due to the selection of multiple playable characters, each with their distinct fighting styles and special moves. Additionally, the player can also ""cancel"" during animation by performing another move, allowing for a combination of several basic and special moves. Both of these features would be expanded upon in subsequent installments.","Any[1, 18, 268435460, 536870973, 536870979, 536871139, 536871213, 536871470, 536871487, 536871506, 536871872, 536871882, 536871971, 536871987, 536872010, 536872211, 536872258, 536872287, 536872617, 536872898, 536872961, 536873021, 536873192, 536873590, 536874209, 536874398, 536874706, 536874743, 536874745, 536875046, 536875073, 536875075, 536875083, 536875091, 536875101, 536875125, 536875151, 536875201, 536875207, 536875208, 536875214, 536875229, 536875303, 536875305, 536875342, 536875377, 536875440, 536875493, 536875511, 536875538, 536875609, 536875662, 536875689, 536875691, 536875734, 536875760, 536875822, 536875852, 536875912, 536875917, 536875934, 536875942, 536876028, 536876029, 536876031, 536876270, 536876273, 536876287, 536876353, 536876474, 536876526, 536876633, 536876634, 536876687, 536876754, 536876805, 536876806, 536876820, 536876880, 536877297, 536877607, 536877608, 536877696, 536878037, 536878087, 536878199, 536878209, 536878439, 536880873]",Null,"Any[1, 2]",Null,"Any[27400, 27401, 27402]","Any[6, 13, 15, 16, 19, 25, 26, 33, 47, 52, 58, 63]","Any[1006, 1103, 3166, 3222, 7386, 12597, 13677, 26855, 45184]",Street Fighter II

Freeman survives, finds other survivors, and makes his way to the surface with the protection of his hazard suit to get help. Upon reaching the surface, however, he finds that the facility is being cleansed of any living thing - human or alien - by armed forces. From other scientists, Freeman finds the only way to stop the alien invasion is to cross over to Xen and destroy the entity holding the portal open.","Black Mesa is a re-envisioning of Valve Software's classic science fiction first person shooter, Half-Life.

This release of Super Mario Bros. 2 is completely different from its original Japanese counterpart, known as Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels. Being in fact a version of Yume Kōjō: Dokidoki Panic with a different storyline and protagonists swapped for Mario and his friends, one of the central game mechanics that differentiates Super Mario Bros. 2 from other Super Mario games is that players can select four characters (Mario, Luigi, Toad, or Princess Toadstool) and each of these characters have their unique gameplay mechanics, offering advantages and disadvantages in their stats. Another distinction is that players cannot defeat enemies by stomping on them, they need to either toss items at enemies or pick up and toss enemies at each other to defeat them.","Any[1, 268435464, 536871049, 536871208, 536871306, 536871470, 536871506, 536871533, 536871971, 536872010, 536872098, 536872105, 536872211, 536872293, 536872594, 536872617, 536872622, 536872961, 536872983, 536873024, 536873048, 536873064, 536873082, 536873111, 536873186, 536873192, 536873362, 536873590, 536873991, 536874209, 536874398, 536874706, 536874743, 536874745, 536874831, 536874966, 536875046, 536875056, 536875057, 536875073, 536875074, 536875075, 536875081, 536875083, 536875091, 536875099, 536875101, 536875109, 536875130, 536875175, 536875198, 536875200, 536875213, 536875229, 536875231, 536875262, 536875305, 536875317, 536875330, 536875362, 536875388, 536875396, 536875397, 536875421, 536875434, 536875437, 536875440, 536875491, 536875524, 536875623, 536875667, 536875672, 536875675, 536875691, 536875713, 536875758, 536875768, 536875791, 536875803, 536875822, 536875830, 536875831, 536875837, 536875839, 536875870, 536875902, 536875924, 536875934, 536876013, 536876016, 536876017, 536876021, 536876069, 536876083, 536876120, 536876215, 536876277, 536876298, 536876351, 536876354, 536876361, 536876415, 536876447, 536876448, 536876499, 536876506, 536876509, 536876572, 536876633, 536876713, 536876753, 536876888, 536876927, 536876952, 536877049, 536877056, 536877059, 536877063, 536877072, 536877075, 536877086, 536877088, 536877089, 536877090, 536877093, 536877237, 536877280, 536877290, 536877434, 536877495, 536877559, 536877570, 536877573, 536877589, 536877659, 536877690, 536877710, 536878024, 536878054, 536878148, 536878192, 536878241, 536878284, 536878468, 536878505, 536878519, 536878604, 536879148, 536879792, 536879808, 536879881, 536880121, 536880135, 536880158, 536880251, 536880283, 536880360, 536880854, 536880991, 536881059, 536881123, 536881666, 536881845, 536881940, 536881947, 536881992, 536882227, 536882660, 536882765, 536882965, 536883574, 536883615, 536883675, 536883783, 536883784, 536883785, 536883786, 536883787, 536883788, 536883789, 536883790, 536883791, 536883792, 536883793, 536883794, 536883795, 536885993]",Null,Any[1],Null,"Any[97438, 97439]","Any[5, 18, 37, 41]","Any[358, 1026, 1029, 1035, 1068, 1078, 1090, 2180, 3349]",Super Mario Bros. 2

Mercer (voiced by Barry Pepper) who wakes up in a morgue in the basement of Gentek, a genetic engineering company based in Manhattan, sending a pair of scientists that were just about to perform an autopsy running. Alex escapes, and witnesses the scientists being gunned down by military operatives. Alex is discovered and attacked. He survives bullets being fired into his chest, and leaps over a wall to safety. He soon discovers he now possesses powerful shapeshifting abilities, superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, senses, endurance, weaponry and the ability to ""consume"" people to gain their memories, skills and appearance. With no memory of his previous life, Alex decides to find and consume those related to the conspiracy in order to uncover the truth. During his quest, Alex faces two factions: the United States Marine Corps and Blackwatch, a Fort Detrick special forces unit dedicated to combating biological warfare; and the Infected, monsters created by a virus known as BLACKLIGHT that is overrunning Manhattan. Captain Robert Cross (voiced by Jeffrey Pierce), a Blackwatch officer, is given orders to find and contain Alex. 
 
Alex makes contact with his sister, Dana (voiced by Lake Bell), who assists him in tracking down targets, leading to the infiltration of Gentek headquarters. He finds a young woman called Elizabeth Greene contained in the building. Greene is a host for BLACKLIGHT and upon her escape unleashes it upon Manhattan. Dana directs Alex to Karen Parker, his ex-girlfriend. She agrees to aid him in stopping the virus, while requiring Alex to bring back samples of the virus. Karen later leads Alex into a trap, where he is confronted by Cross. During their battle, Alex almost defeated Cross when Cross mentioned 'Penn Station', triggering a flashback that leaves Alex dazed. Alex is injected with a parasite that threatens to kill him. Alex seeks help from Dr. Ragland, a pathologist linked to Gentek. Ragland helps Alex remove the parasite and turn it into a weapon against Greene. However, it has no effect on Greene as her body rejected the parasite immediately, and the rejected biomass forms a monstrous being, the Supreme Hunter, which Alex kills. 
 
The origins of the virus and Elizabeth Greene are uncovered through a contact: in 1969 the government tested the virus' predecessor in Hope, Idaho, designed to target predetermined races. The virus mutated into something far more deadly, and the whole population was infected. Elizabeth Greene was the sole survivor; an anomaly in her body's biology accepted the virus, rewriting her genetic code along with that of her unborn son, codenamed PARIAH. The remaining population of Hope, Idaho, was liquidated by Blackwatch. Greene and PARIAH were kept in captivity for further research. 
 
Alex discovers his own past: Blackwatch shut down the Gentek project due to leaks and ordered all project personnel eliminated. Alex Mercer took a sample of BLACKLIGHT as ""insurance"". Eventually pinned down by Blackwatch in Penn Station. Alex, in a final act of desperation and vengeance shatters the vial containing the BLACKLIGHT, releasing the virus before being gunned down. The virus entered Mercer's bloodstream through the bullet holes and repaired his body at the cellular level. 
 
The contact and Alex pump a new ""BLOODTOX"" biological agent underground in order to drive the virus above ground where it can be fought directly, causing Greene to emerge, encased in a towering monstrosity. Greene falls from the monster in human form once she is defeated, and is consumed by Alex. Through her memories, it becomes apparent that General Randall, head of Blackwatch, is prepared to destroy Manhattan with a nuclear weapon. The contact, revealed to be Cross. Alex with the Captains help, infiltrates the USS Ronald Reagan to stop Randall. Once Alex consumes Randall, Cross is revealed to be the Supreme Hunter, who assumed Cross' identity after consuming him, and attacks Alex, asserting that when Blackwatch leaves NYZ they will no longer be searching for infected, and that after he consumes Alex, he will then be strong enough survive the nuclear detonation. Alex defeats the Supreme Hunter and moves the weapon out into the Atlantic Ocean with a helicopter, where it detonates and catches him in the blast. His remains float back to the city and regenerate after consuming a crow. 
 
During the credits, it is revealed that the public considers the military to have been the one who stopped the infection; a US Senator is heard telling the media that the events in Manhattan were a case of nuclear and biological terrorism, and promises retribution upon those responsible. Alex, reflecting on the events that occurred and the truth he uncovered about himself, claims he has ""become something less than human, but also something more"". After the credits, Manhattan is shown to be slowly recovering, the virus has been almost completely eradicated.

Originally released in 1996, Resident Evil  was then “remade” in 2002 from the ground up with new visuals, gameplay elements, environments and story details while retaining the survival horror atmosphere the series had become synonymous for. Both fans of the franchise who want a trip down memory lane and those who have yet to experience the game that coined the term survival horror for the gaming world will appreciate this definitive re-visit of that iconic 2002 Resident Evil title.  
 
The intense horror fans first experienced with the release of the original Resident Evil is back. Taking place in the now notorious Raccoon City, players will choose to take on the role of either S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Service) team member Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, who have been sent into the city to find the missing Bravo team.

Time passes, the pages turn…and a new chapter unfolds in an unfamiliar land! Get ready for a two-dimensional role-playing adventure for the ages as Mario returns to paper form to discover a mystery that sleeps behind an ancient, legendary portal called the Thousand-Year Door. The quest is long, the dangers many, and this time, Mario will have to make full use of his papery qualities just to survive. 
 
Take to the stage! Impressing the crowd builds power for super attacks, but don’t disappoint the audience, or you’ll pay! 
 
No need to go it alone! You’ll need to rely on sidekicks to survive, and even enemies have roles to play…

The heroes are recruited from 15 different classes each class with its own unique skills and abilities. 
 
Combat occurs in narrow passages which means the party's order is important in respect to the heroes' class and the player's strategy. As an example, a crusader is a good front unit having both high attack and defense values while the plague doctor might be better further behind throwing plague bombs to spread disease and confusion. 
 
Instead of leveling, heroes have ""resolve"" which will increase as they adventure. Fighting and events will test the hero's resolve and they might develop afflictions if they fail their resolve. This can turn out both positively and negatively creating different set of afflictions for every hero. 
 
While exploring the dungeons, the light of the heroes torch becomes dimmer, which means the dungeons gets more dangerous but yields better loot as well. The heroes have to camp to replenish the torch in the dungeons.

Isaac, a child, and his mother live in a small house on a hill, both happily keeping to themselves, with Isaac drawing pictures and playing with his toys, and his mother watching Christian broadcasts on television. Isaac's mother then hears ""a voice from above"", stating her son is corrupted with sin, and needs to be saved. It asks her to remove all that was evil from Isaac, in an attempt to save him. His mother obliges, taking away his toys, drawings, and even his clothes. 
 
The voice once again speaks to Isaac's mother, stating that Isaac must be cut off from all that is evil in the world. Once again, his mother obliges, and locks Isaac inside his room. Once more, the voice speaks to Isaac's mother. It states she has done well, but it still questions her devotion, and requests she sacrifice her son.

Orochi's horrid curse spread all across the land, turning it into a veritable hell on earth, infested with countless monsters roaming the earth. But there was one hope. The majestic, wolf-embodied sun god Amaterasu. 
 
One-hundred years ago, Amaterasu used the godly power of the Celestial Brush, to face Orochi. But their battle consumed them both, causing them to disappear from the world, with Amaterasu losing the thirteen Celestial Brush powers in the process. 
 
Now in the present, Amaterasu stumbles upon a mysterious fairy sprite named Issun, and together they set out on an adventure, as Amaterasu aims to regain the 13 powers of the Celestial brush and defeat Orochi once and for all.","Set sometime in classical Japanese history, Ōkami combines several Japanese mythology and folklore to tell the story of how the land was saved from darkness by the Shinto sun goddess named Amaterasu, who took the form of a white wolf with celestial markings covering its fur.

One Dead Echo team, led by Grayson Hunt (Steven Blum), having been following Sarrano's orders in assassinating what they believe are drug traffickers and mass murderers, kill a man known as Bryce Novak, but soon discover he was a civilian reporter, having documented other civilian deaths caused by Dead Echo. Grayson and his team realize they have been duped by Sarrano and go AWOL, becoming space pirates on the run from Sarrano's forces, now going by the name Final Echo.

Ten years later, Grayson's team tries to flee from Sarrano's battlecruiser, the Ulysses, while near the planet of Stygia. With their ship's systems failing, Grayson, in a drunken stupor, orders the crew to ram at the Ulysses, hoping to gain revenge on Sarraro. The ships collide, forcing both down and causing them to crash land on the surface of Stygia. One of Grayson's men, Ishi Sato (Andrew Kishino), is critically wounded in the crash and Grayson is forced to find an energy cell to drive the ship's medical equipment. On the planet, a former popular tropical-like resort destination, the population has mutated into feral tribes and carnivorous plants. Grayson fights through to one of the Ulysses escape pods, where a Final Echo soldier succumbs to a horde of mutants. After dispatching the attackers, Grayson retrieves the escape pod's energy cell, as well as an ""instinct leash"" that, when worn, begins to provide him strange tactile information, such as points for each enemy he kills.

Grayson returns with the cell, and while Ishi is under operation, the mutants attack their ship. The operation is cut short by an explosion during battle, leaving Ishi a disfigured cyborg. Grayson and Ishi, the only survivors, decide to work together to get off the planet, despite Ishi's disapproval of Grayson's thirst for revenge. The instinct leash leads Grayson to another escape pod, where they find Trishka (Jennifer Hale), another Final Echo soldier who agrees to work with Grayson and Ishi, but only after they rescue Sarrano. As they battle through the ravaged city, Trishka explains that Stygia has been used by Final Echo as a sort of training grounds, with the instinct leashes the soldiers wear as a means of ranking those within the test; those that scored kills would be the only ones that could get ammunition and other supplies to survive. When Grayson learns that Trishka was Novak's daughter, he tells her that Sarrano was responsible for her father's death, but claims he does not know who actually killed him.

The three make their way to the top of a skyscraper where Sarrano's pod landed. Trishka accuses Sarrano of her father's death, but he simply kicks her off the side of the building. Sarrano then warns Grayson and Ishi that there is an armed DNA bomb on the Ulysses that will wipe out all life on the planet, and that they must go and disarm it, as his rescue ship will not arrive in time. Sarrano leads them through the underground areas of the city, encountering radioactive waste and a giant prison. Sarrano snidely explains that that shields used to protect the planet's surface from its deadly electrical storms created the waste, and in turn, began to mutate the population of the surface; the changes occurred too quickly for most of the surface population to be rescued, and thus many of the feral mutants that Grayson has been fighting were more innocent civilians. Grayson is furious at this revelation, but continues to help Sarrano to reach the remains the Ulysses. Aboard, Sarrano tricks Grayson and Ishi once again, having them actually arm the DNA bomb, while his rescue ship will arrive in time to save him. As fire breaks out aboard the fallen ship, the two are saved by Trishka, who survived the fall by catching a power line on her way down.

The three race to where Sarrano's rescue ship is landing and manage to get on board. They make their way through Sarrano's elite troops and eventually face Sarrano alone. Trishka demands to know who actually killed her father, to which Sarrano indicts Grayson. In the confusion, Sarrano hijack's Ishi's computer systems, forcing him to turn on his friends. Grayson manages to break Sarrano's control of Ishi, and Ishi sacrifices himself to prevent Sarrano from killing Grayson. Grayson then impales Sarrano on the wall of a ship. As Grayson and Trishka regroup, Sarrano performs one final act, ejecting Grayson, Trishka and several of his men from the ship back onto the planet. With the DNA bomb soon to detonate, Grayson and Trishka race back to the Ulysses where one escape pod remains unlaunched; they are able to board it and escape into low orbit, out of range of the DNA bomb when it goes off.","Bulletstorm brings new furor to first-person shooter action thanks to its signature 'kill with skill' gameplay. The game tells the story of a futuristic confederation protected by an elite band of mercenaries: Dead Echo. When Dead Echo members Grayson Hunt and Ishi Sato learn they've been working for the wrong side, they're betrayed by their commander and exiled to the far reaches of the galaxy. In Bulletstorm, Grayson and Ishi find themselves surrounded by hordes of mutants and flesh eating gangs in an abandoned paradise. They have two objectives: get off the planet alive, and exact revenge on the man who sent them there.

Players step into the role of Grayson Hunt complete with an arsenal of over-the-top combat moves and outrageously large guns. Bulletstorm's array of distinct 'skillshots' produces unprecedented levels of frantic gameplay and yell-inducing satisfaction. The skillshot system rewards players for inciting mayhem in the most creative way possible. The more insane the skillshot, the more points players collects to upgrade their character and unlock weapons, which then allows them to execute even more creative moves and exaggerated skillshots.","Any[1, 18, 27, 268435461, 536870937, 536870999, 536871018, 536871041, 536871074, 536871262, 536871365, 536871378, 536871487, 536871727, 536871835, 536871882, 536871937, 536871972, 536872009, 536872070, 536872205, 536872245, 536872358, 536872800, 536873053, 536873064, 536873455, 536873904, 536874539, 536874743, 536875089, 536875090, 536875125, 536875157, 536875199, 536875242, 536875265, 536875271, 536875293, 536875319, 536875396, 536875432, 536875453, 536875459, 536875492, 536875526, 536875527, 536875532, 536875610, 536875638, 536875781, 536875802, 536875807, 536875814, 536875819, 536875830, 536875885, 536875887, 536875941, 536875944, 536876023, 536876189, 536876199, 536876221, 536876235, 536876261, 536876355, 536876356, 536876469, 536876506, 536876552, 536876572, 536876596, 536876603, 536876695, 536876762, 536876817, 536876821, 536876855, 536876901, 536876934, 536876948, 536876987, 536877016, 536877108, 536877144, 536877217, 536877283, 536877288, 536877302, 536877369, 536877497, 536877604, 536877950, 536877952, 536877956, 536877968, 536877994, 536878002, 536878026, 536878112, 536878266, 536879711, 536879758, 536879881, 536879910, 536880084, 536880222, 536880223, 536880318, 536880465, 536880704, 536880711, 536880901, 536880946, 536881123, 536882115, 536882461, 536882698, 536883253, 536883374, 536883375, 536883766, 536883767, 536883768, 536883769, 536888127, 536889044, 536889479, 536891450, 536892494]",Any[6],"Any[1, 2]",Any[590],"Any[33822, 33824, 87915]","Any[6, 9, 12, 36, 45]","Any[356, 471, 514, 547, 564, 571, 1006, 1021, 7020]",Bulletstorm

At the same time, Cole has learned from his future self, Kessler, that a powerful Conduit known as the ""Beast"" will rise to destroy the world and that only he has the power to defeat him. 
 
Story 
Following the events of InFAMOUS, Cole (Eric Ladin) and his friend Zeke (Caleb Moody) meet with NSA agent Lucy Kuo (Dawn Olivieri), who informs them that Dr. Sebastian Wolfe (Michael Ensign), the man responsible for creating the Ray Sphere that gave Cole his powers, has developed an even stronger version that would give him enough strength to stop the Beast. Before they can depart for Wolfe's lab in New Marais, the Beast attacks Empire City. Cole tries to fight him off, but even his most powerful attack proves useless. The group is subsequently forced to flee as Empire City is completely and utterly destroyed. 
 
Arriving in New Marais, Cole and his allies learn that energy magnate Joseph Bertrand III (Graham McTavish), an anti-Conduit demagogue, has seized control of the city. Aware of Wolfe's intentions, Bertrand has his private army, the Militia, destroy the doctor's lab. Rescuing Wolfe, Cole learns that he has developed the Ray Field Inhibitor, a device capable of stripping Conduits of their powers. Before he can help Cole locate the energy cores needed to power the RFI, he is killed by the Militia, who also take Kuo captive. While working to free her, Cole and Zeke meet Roscoe Laroche, a Vietnam veteran who leads a resistance movement opposed to Bertrand, and Nix (Nika Futterman), a Conduit with the ability to manipulate and ignite a black, napalm-like substance, who has been waging war on the Militia. Using intelligence gathered by Zeke, Cole and Nix locate a secret lab where Kuo, revealed to be a Conduit, has been forced to transfer her ice-generating powers to an army of human mercenaries controlled by Bertrand.

However, in the game's second case, Mia is murdered for being aware of corporate blackmail, and her younger sister Maya Fey is charged with the crime because her name was found on a piece of evidence. While defending her, Phoenix is reintroduced to another childhood friend, Miles Edgeworth, who is the prosecutor for Maya's case and has established himself as a ""genius"" for the prosecution system. Maya is found not guilty of the crime, and becomes Phoenix's assistant in further cases, offering her channeling ability as a ""Spirit Medium"" of Kurain village to bring the spirit of Mia to help at critical times. Phoenix and Edgeworth find that while they have their friendship from their youth, they continue to face off against each other in the courtroom. In the third case, Phoenix and Maya investigate the murder of a famous actor.In the fourth case, Edgeworth is charged with murder, and Phoenix steps up to defend him. It is discovered that Edgeworth was set up by his old mentor, Manfred von Karma. Several years earlier, Manfred shot and killed Edgeworth's father, a defense attorney, after he ruined Manfred's perfect record, but led Edgeworth to believe he shot his own father. Phoenix is able to expose Manfred's cover-up and achieve a ""not guilty"" verdict for Edgeworth. After the case, Edgeworth thinks about taking time off from his position to consider the events, while Maya announces she is going back to her home in Kurain Village to train. 
The fifth case, added for the Nintendo DS, iOS, and Wii versions, has Ema Skye begging Wright for help to defend her older sister Lana, who is on trial for murder, compounded by a second murder of the same apparent victim in a different building at the same time. Using Ema's scientific help to establish evidence and the surprising prosecution help of Edgeworth during the trial, Phoenix is able to learn that Lana Skye was blackmailed by the Chief of Police Damon Gant into covering for a murder she thought that Ema had committed several years before. Gant himself is revealed to have committed the murder and pinned the blame on Ema. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she willingly goes to jail for being an accomplice; Ema says her goodbyes as she heads to Europe to study forensic science.","Meet Phoenix Wright, the rookie defense lawyer new to the scene with the wildest cross-examination skills in town!

Once at the village, Kate learns that the woman who owned the factory has just died, and she has a brother who must be contacted in order for the takeover to proceed. Her mission takes her across Central and Eastern Europe, which gradually leads her to question her own life. The titular Syberia is a mythical island on which mammoths are said to live. 
 
The game starts with Kate arriving in the fictional French village of Valadilène and witnessing the funeral of Anna Voralberg, the owner of a family-owned spring-automaton toy factory. When Kate visits the village notary to finalize the deal, the notary tells her that just before Anna's death, the old lady revealed that her brother is not dead and buried, but alive somewhere in the North-East. Now that his sister is dead, Hans Voralberg becomes the new owner of the factory, which cannot be sold without his approval. Kate has no choice: If she wants the takeover to succeed, she will have to find Hans. Kate's research reveals that Hans was injured in his attempt to retrieve a prehistoric doll of a man riding a mammoth. It stunted his development, leaving him mentally handicapped, and Hans' sole goal became to find mammoths to ride as the doll depicts. 
 
In order to find Hans, Kate must take his train: a clockwork locomotive built by his sister at his request. It is manned by Oscar, an animatronic man fond of protocol whom Kate must satisfy to depart. She is forced to dive into Hans' past to retrieve two items of value to him: the mammoth doll and a clockwork music box. 
 
As she follows Hans' path, Kate makes her way to Barrockstadt, a failing university whose train station acts as a botanical garden. The train stops short of the winding mechanism so Kate must barter with a nearby couple with a barge. They insist on being paid $100 for their assistance, so Kate has to fix the university's broken bandstand to get the university's stubborn board of directors to help. Along the way, she gets a lesson on the legend of Syberia and the customs of the mysterious prehistoric Youkol people who lived with mammoths and were able to domesticate them. Before she can leave Barrockstadt entirely, she must pass the large wall that keeps her train from exiting. 
 
The next stop is Komkolzgrad, a dusty Communist-era industrial mining complex with two giant metallic worker-automata overlooking the tracks. The place is run by the eccentric and somewhat crazy Serguei Borodine, who steals Oscar's hands to make his automaton organist work. He intends to construct the biggest stage possible for Helena Romanski, a washed-up opera singer with whom he is obsessed. Kate has little choice but to fetch her from a nearby spa in Aralbad on his behalf. Serguei directs Kate to the adjacent cosmodrome for transportation. 
 
At the cosmodrome, Kate meets former test pilot Boris, a drunk who dreams of flying into space on a ""flying wing"" invented by Hans. After some sobering up, he teaches Kate how to operate an old airship in exchange for her help in making the flying wing functional. He also warns Kate not to trust Serguei. Once Boris is launched, she uses his advice to launch the airship and leaves for Aralbad. 
 
At the Aralbad spa, Kate meets Helena after getting past the manager. The elderly lady believes she is too old to sing, having lost her legendary voice, which could break glass. With a special cocktail mixed at the bar and a wine glass, Kate convinces Helena that she can still sing. Helena agrees to go with Kate. 
 
The performance in Komkolzgrad does not go quite as planned: beautiful though Helena's voice may be (she sings ""Dark Eyes""), it doesn't stop Serguei from imprisoning her, as he wants to keep Helena at his side as his personal opera singer. Kate is able to free Helena and take back Oscar's hands, but Serguei isn't quite willing to give up without a fight, using the worker-automata to block the train. Some spare dynamite dispatches that problem, and Kate brings Helena back to Aralbad. Surprisingly, none other than Hans Voralberg is waiting there at the spa, delighted that Kate brought him his train and Oscar. Hans shows little concern for his sister's death and signs the factory release papers without even reading them. He offers to take Kate along, but she initially refuses. However, as she is about to board a plane to fly back to New York, she changes her mind and hops on board the train at the last second, abandoning her job and her unfaithful fiancé back home to help an old man realize his dream.","Syberia is a 2002 computer adventure game designed by Benoît. It follows Kate Walker, the protagonist, as she attempts to wrap up a sale on behalf of her law firm.

An old Hero, Maze, rescues the boy, seeing great potential in him; Maze trains the boy to become a Hero at the Heroes' Guild. Years pass; after honing his skills, Maze informs the Hero of a blind seeress living among a bandit camp near Oakvale, and advises the Hero to infiltrate the bandit camp. To the Hero's surprise, the blind seeress is actually his older sister Theresa who was taken in by Twinblade, a former Hero and the present Bandit King. After a showdown with Twinblade, the Hero is given the choice of killing or sparing the bandit.

Later on in the Hero's life, after he has gained more recognition among the people of Albion, he is invited to fight in the Arena, where he meets the legendary Hero named Jack of Blades, who runs the arena battles. As a final challenge, Jack pits the Hero against his rival, which was also once his childhood friend/room-mate back in the Guild - Whisper; when the Hero defeats her he may kill or spare her.

The Hero learns that Jack of Blades himself destroyed Oakvale during the Hero's childhood; aided by Theresa, the Hero discovers his mother alive in Bargate Prison. The Hero is captured in the rescue attempt and spends a year or more in the prison before finally escaping. Maze is revealed to be a traitor and working with Jack. Maze kidnaps Theresa. After defeating Maze, the Hero is led into a final confrontation with Jack where his mother is killed. Jack reveals that The Sword of Aeons can only be wielded if it receives the blood of Archon. The Sword of Aeons is said to be a very powerful sword of destruction. Upon the death of their mother, the Hero and Theresa are the only two remaining descendants of Archon, and if Jack destroys them both the sword will be even more powerful. After defeating Jack, the Hero must choose whether to keep the Sword of Aeons by killing his sister, or cast it away forever into a portal created by Jack of Blades' death.

Depending on the Hero's alignment and the player's choice of using or destroying the sword, there are a total of four different endings. Once the ending credits roll, players can resume their games.

In The Lost Chapters special edition, the story continues. After the defeat of Jack, the Hero must find passage to the Northern Wastes to aid a legendary hero named Scythe in stopping an unknown great evil from returning. Should the hero have discarded the Sword of Aeons he will have the opportunity to gain the sword ""Avo's Tear"", a sword of similar design and equal power but that holds a light alignment rather than dark. Avo is said to be a god that represents the light side alignment. After a series of quests revolving around this new evil, it is learned that Jack of Blades has returned. He must then defeat Jack of Blades a second time, Jack having returned from the dead in the form of a dragon. Upon the death of Jack, the hero then uses Jack's mask to capture Jack's soul, with Scythe telling him that the battle is not over and that he must destroy the mask. The hero then has the final choice of putting on the mask - being consumed by Jack in the process - or destroying it, along with Jack, forever.","In Fable, the players' every action determines their character's skills, appearances and moralities. Life stories are created from childhood through adulthood and on to old age. Players may choose the paths of righteousness or dedicate their characters' lives to evil; observing as they transform into reflections of their actions and decisions.

Afterward, mining incidents were on the increase, and efforts to deal with them were unsuccessful. The government then came up with the idea of giving the violence an outlet instead. ""Consensual murder"" was legalized in the year 2291, enabling people to fight to the death under organized conditions. Mining conglomerates worked with the government and organized leagues, which proved successful. One such company, the Liandri Mining Corporation, capitalized on the fights by tri-casting them; this proved to be more popular than the combat itself, their popularity increasing with brutality.

Ratchet recovers the robot from the wreckage, naming him “Clank.” Clank shows Ratchet a recording of Chairman Drek of the Blarg race. In the recording, Drek explains that his home planet has become so polluted it is now uninhabitable. Drek’s solution is to build a new planet for his race by extracting areas from other planets! What’s worse is that Drek has developed a superweapon called the Deplanetizer which will destroy Veldin to make room for his new planet. Fearing that Drek will destroy everything in his path, Ratchet and Clank team up for their first explosive adventure to save the galaxy.","Ratchet & Clank is a platform/adventure game in a similar vein to the 3D versions of the Rayman, Sonic, Mario, or other games. It involves the two protagonists Ratchet, a furry alien creature, and Clank, a nerdy little robot, going on a quest to find Captain Qwark and ultimately to help save the galaxy. 
 
Ratchet & Clank includes many of the best features of previous similar games, but makes itself unique in a number of ways. Firstly each of the game's levels are huge sweeping vistas with extremely detailed buildings which are visible at all times (i.e. there is no distance fog). This means that a building on the horizon is not just a ""backdrop""; in all likelihood Ratchet will be exploring it in a few moments time. Secondly, the game includes a number of sub-games, such as a space fight sequence and a number of turret shoot-outs which are akin to Missile Command in the first person. 
 
The game has over twenty levels (planets) and includes as many real-time cut-scenes which tell the story.

According to the developers, their aim was to create a ""mature game for adults in the vein of Game of Thrones or The Black Company"". They intend to engage players emotionally by allowing them to build relationships with the game's characters and shape the outcome of the story through an array of conversation choices.[8] The game eschews certain conventions of action-oriented computer role-playing games such as the focus on a young lone hero's story, looting and buying items, or reloading a saved game state after defeat. Instead, the developers intended to tell the story of the player's caravan as a whole, and encourage players to accept and deal with the consequences of any defeats they may encounter.[9] 
 
The first game in the Saga centers on the return of the Dredge, a warlike race that despises humans led by the Bellower, a nigh invincible Dredge who leads them on a warpath on human and Varl. As a wandering army sent to fight against the Dredge and find a weakness for the Bellower, many difficult decisions are made by the caravan that would shape the fate of both man and Varl.","The Banner Saga is a Viking-themed tactical role-playing video game by Stoic, a trio of indie game developers formerly of BioWare.

Survivors come together to form settlements around oases and other practical or habitable locations, while the wastes are plagued by various bandits clans, and mutants, who attack all normal humans in a voracious horde. 
 
In 2135, former U.S. Marine Lieutenant Nicholas Raine emerges from an underground shelter called an Ark, 106 years after being put into stasis. These underground shelters are the direct result of the Eden Project, a massive international undertaking in which hundreds of Arks, containing cryogenic pods, were sealed under the surface of the Earth to preserve enough of the human population to rebuild civilization after the asteroid collision. The Eden Project was far less successful than hoped, as Raine's Ark in particular was heavily damaged, with all of its other residents dead and equipment destroyed, and he wakes up alone with no specific goal in mind. 
 
Raine enters the surface, where he is immediately attacked by bandits but is saved by Dan Hagar, a local wasteland settler who brings Raine to his settlement. Hagar informs him that a powerful technologically advanced organization known as the Authority, that considers itself the one true government of the wasteland, is hunting for Ark survivors for an unknown purpose. Raine briefly aids Hagar's settlement and others in the local area by completing a few small jobs, and during this time it is revealed that the nanotrites injected into Raine's blood before he was sent into hibernation have granted him superhuman abilities to help him survive the harsh environment, but have made him valuable to the Authority. Hagar believes Raine's continued presence is too dangerous for the settlement and sends him to the nearby town of Wellspring instead. 
 
In Wellspring, Raine helps the town with various problems such as fighting off bandits, mutants, and ferrying supplies. Eventually, he comes into contact with Dr. Kvasir, an elderly scientist who previously worked for the Authority, who tells Raine about the inhumane experiments they were responsible for, such as the creation of the mutants. Kvasir puts him into contact with the Resistance, an armed anti-Authority group, where he is tasked with rescuing their leader, Captain Marshall, who has recently been imprisoned by the Authority. Raine again attracts attention from the Authority, forcing him to flee Wellspring and join the Resistance at their headquarters in Subway Town, where he earns the trust of the town and its tyrannical mayor, Redstone. He also learns what had happened in the past century from Captain Marshall, who is an Ark survivor himself. General Martin Cross, who was in charge of the Eden Project, sabotaged the operation shortly before 99942 Apophis struck the Earth by ensuring that only the Arks with people loyal to him were opened on schedule, with this first wave of Ark survivors eventually forming the Authority. The remaining Arks were supposed to stay underground forever in hibernation, including Raine's Ark, which surfaced only because its systems were damaged and it automatically rose to protect any surviving inhabitants. 
 
With the Authority beginning to forcefully expand its influence on the wasteland settlements, the Resistance is forced to act with the help of Raine who can recover data that shows the location of every Ark on the planet. Captain Marshall plans to use this data to activate all the Arks and form an army that can defeat the Authority, but the only way to do this is to transmit the data from Capital Prime, the main headquarters for the Authority. Alone, Raine fights his way through Capital Prime to transmit the Ark activation code, and the game concludes with all the remaining Arks simultaneously becoming active and surfacing.","RAGE is a groundbreaking first-person shooter set in the not-too-distant future after an asteroid impacts Earth, leaving a ravaged world behind.

One of the Curators, a rogue Creator called ""the Collector"", is stealing the other Creators' creations and not sharing them with the world (sharing is one of the core elements of LittleBigPlanet). Play starts at the ""Gardens"" level, where the player meets the King, one of the Curators; the Queen; Little Xim; Big Zam and Dumpty. The player is taught the basic gameplay at this stage: running, jumping, and grabbing. The next setting is the ""Savannah"", where the player accidentally breaks one of the ruler's creations. In return for forgiveness the player must investigate what's scaring the ruler's buffalo. Further adventures involve finding Meerkat Mum's son and a Bridegroom (a story arc with a Day of the Dead theme). After the wedding play moves to the ""Canyons"", where the player must rescue Uncle Jalapeño and defeat the evil Sheriff Zapata. After completing this the player is taken to the ""Metropolis"" and gets a car for a race scenario. The next adventure takes place on the ""Islands"", where the player is trained in martial arts and must defeat the Terrible Oni. From there the player goes to the ""Temples"", to get a flame-throwing cat. Here they meet the Great Magician, who tells them to defeat the Collector in his ""Wilderness"". After the final battle the Collector is revealed to be a little, lonely man who kidnapped everyone because he did not have any friends. Everyone, including the player, offers to be his friend and he accepts, ending his being evil.","The core mechanics of the series revolve around its tagline ""Play, Create, Share"". 
The Play component involves players taking control of Sackboy and navigating him through various levels. In the first two instalments of the series, gameplay consisted primarily of traditional platforming like jumping and avoiding obstacles to successfully navigate to the end of a level to win. Since LittleBigPlanet 2, gameplay has expanded to being a ""platform for games"" with the introduction of numerous mini-games and other genres into the game diversifying the game from being strictly a traditional platforming game. Most LittleBigPlanet games involve a player playing solo or co-operatively with friends to navigate through a level whilst collecting various ""prize bubbles"" along the way. These prize bubbles come in two types, small ones which constitute points and larger ones that contain new costumes, stickers or other type of collectibles that can be used to customise Sackboy or in level creation. There are also numerous co-operative parts of levels whereby certain prize bubbles can only be collected with the help of at least one player or more depending on the number of players stated in the level.","Any[17, 27, 33, 35, 268435464, 536872407, 536872961, 536874136, 536877186, 536890619]",Null,"Any[1, 2, 3]",Any[11300],"Any[4506, 104330]",Any[9],"Any[19164, 20342, 24426, 37001, 77349, 77529, 109581, 113360, 119156]",LittleBigPlanet
