Thus players capture invisible creatures called ""invizimals"" to use them in battles against other invizimals in tournament-style matches.  Capturing  invizimals means shooting them with fireballs, luring them into the PSP camera, surrounding them with flames;  Fighting  means that the little fantasy creatures use elemental (fire, wind, ice, etc.) and physical attacks to defeat their animated opponents. Invizimals can ""claw-slash,"" spit fire, shoot spikes, or use toxic flatulence to inflict damage. One creature (Flameclaw) stabs itself with its stinger if it loses a match; another creature (Skysaur) shoots projectiles from its rear end; and the Bongorilla invizimal picks its nose and wipes its boogers on the ground. The game contains live-action cutscenes in which real actors sometimes push and shove each other; the scenes are often dramatic and may include frequent references to kidnapping, or discussions about ""weaponizing"" the invizimals.",E10,ESRB

990,1,Any[],11,"In this open-world action game, players assume the role of three criminals whose storylines intersect within the fictional city of Los Santos. Players can switch between each character to follow his storyline, completing missions which often include criminal activities (e.g., stealing cars, executing heists, assassinating targets). Players use pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, and explosives to kill various enemies (e.g., rival gang members); players also have the ability to shoot non-adversary civilians, though this may negatively affect players' progress as a penalty system triggers a broad police search. Blood-splatter effects occur frequently, and the game contains rare depictions of dismemberment.  In one sequence, players are directed to use various instruments and means (e.g., pipe wrench, tooth removal, electrocution) to extract information from a character; the sequence is intense and prolonged, and it involves some player interaction (i.e., responding to on-screen prompts). The game includes depictions of sexual material/activity: implied fellatio and masturbation; various sex acts that the player's character procures from a prostitute—while no nudity is depicted in these sequences, various sexual moaning sounds can be heard. Nudity is present, however, primarily in two settings: a topless lap dance in a strip club and a location that includes male cult members with exposed genitalia in a non-sexual context. Within the game, TV programs and radio ads contain instances of mature humor: myriad sex jokes; depictions of raw sewage and feces on a worker's body; a brief instance of necrophilia (no nudity is depicted). Some sequences within the larger game allow players to use narcotics (e.g., smoking from a bong, lighting a marijuana joint); cocaine use is also depicted. Players' character can, at various times, consume alcohol and drive while under the influence. The words “f**k,”“c*nt,” and “n**ger” can be heard in the dialogue.",M,ESRB

Players use assault rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers, and assorted gadgets (e.g., ninja smoke bombs, grappling guns) to attack enemies in team-based combat. These over-the-top battles are often accompanied by gunfire, large explosions, and cries of pain; brief blood-splatter effects can occur as enemies are shot or injured. Characters can also be temporarily impaled with arrows, or frozen and shattered to pieces as a result of an ice gun. Some female characters are depicted in form-fitting outfits and lingerie that reveal moderate amounts of cleavage; a “sensual” voice option is also available in the customization menu (e.g., “I hope you bats like it rough.”). The game includes character profile phrases such as “Cuts the cheese,”“Holding down the fart,” and “I peed on it. It's mine”; one comical sequence depicts a baby vomiting onto a refrigerator. The dialogue includes language censored by audible bleeps (e.g., “Listen to me, you mother-[bleep] clowns!” and “Yep!

Cartoonlike characters use frying pans, golf clubs, barbeque forks, machine guns, flamethrowers, knives, and swords to kill other actors on the TV/movie sets. Characters are often guided by the instructions and prompting of a TV/movie director. As the characters run around various sets, they are rewarded with notoriety, fame, and points for creative kills. Brightly-colored bloodstains sometimes appear when characters are hit; small bloodstains occasionally appear on floors and walls. Players are also assisted by environmental traps (e.g., electric currents, fiery gas explosions, and movable floors), which can kill several characters at once. Guards will occasionally zap characters with tasers for failing to observe in-game rules, such as refraining from killing innocent or non-targeted characters.  Some female characters are depicted in bikinis, low-cut clothing, bunny outfits, and showgirl costumes that expose a lot of cleavage. A movie set displays a call sheet that details a bedroom scene, with the text ""Please Note: As this scene involves nudity, ONLY the involved actors, the assigned camera op and the director should be present."" During the course of the game, characters may use toilets and can be seen sitting on toilet bowls as they groan and emit flatulence.

327,1,Any[],11,"This is a puzzle adventure game in which players assume the role of Vincent, a man with relationship issues that are manifested in his dreams. The game transitions between animated cutscenes and puzzle stages (i.e., nightmares); in the nightmare world, players must help Vincent ascend crumbling towers by pushing, pulling, and climbing blocks to reach an exit. If players make the wrong move, they can be killed by spike traps and giant boss creatures (e.g., a demon bride, a chainsaw-wielding baby); death scenes are accompanied by exaggerated splashes of blood as Vincent is stabbed, crushed, shot, or bitten. During one cutscene, a character is stabbed in the stomach with a knife; a large pool of blood quickly forms under her body. In order to move faster in the puzzles stages, players can order Vincent alcoholic beverages (e.g., mixed cocktails, beer, sake, whiskey); after three drinks, he begins to stumble around when moving. These sequences are accompanied by voice-over narration: “It's said that chugging alcohol isn't good for you, but sometimes it's necessary” and “[T]ake a big swig of cognac!” Throughout the game, sex and sexuality are frequently referenced, sometimes while two characters are in bed together (e.g., “I finally became a man! Got rid of my V-card, BOOM,”“If the one you loved confessed to a sexual habit that you found absolutely unacceptable, what would you do?” and “After all you've done to my body . . . Night after night . . .”). One bedroom sequence pans across a man's legs, then to his curling toes; another scene briefly depicts a woman caressing her body while making suggestive comments (e.g., “I've got such a hunger for these feelings . . . I know you have some hungers as well, don't you?” ). The game also depicts the central character surrounded by topless female demons—though shadow effects obscure most details.

Aliens are often decapitated or dismembered when hit, sending large splashes of blood across the ground, surrounding walls, and players' screen. Some sequences depict more ""over-the-top"" instances of violence: aliens getting stabbed in the head or impaled; a human soldier bursting into bloody gibs after being tossed through propeller blades. In one sequence, players have the ability to shoot human characters that are trapped in pod-like alien webbing; bodies explode into pieces upon impact.

Fighting can be frenetic and intense, highlighted by various camera effects (e.g., slow motion, blurring, screen shakes) and depictions of realistic dismemberment with trails of red blood.

A screen-blurring effect indicates the state of characters' intoxication and the need to use the narcotic to fend off various side effects.
